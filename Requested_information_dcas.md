### What are Data and Code Availability Statements (DCAS)

Data and Code Availability Statements (DCAS) can take on many forms. The examples below are taken from economics articles. For examples from other domains, see
- [Springer](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/data-availability-statements/12330880)
- [Hindawi](https://www.hindawi.com/research.data/#statement.templates)

Note that not all the examples listed above may be admissible by the journal you are submitting to.

### Examples
#### Example for public use data included in data archive:
> The paper uses data obtained from IPUMS (Ruggles et al, 2017). IPUMS does not currently provide the ability to store or reference custom extracts, but allows for redistribution for the purpose of replication. The archive contains the extracted data, codebook in the folder "data/IPUMS". The data citation in the main article has the full URL. 

#### Example for public use data not included in data archive:
> Data from the Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural Urban Geographic Dataset on India, Version 1.0  is used in this paper. The full dataset and documentation can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DPESAK.

#### Example for public use data with required registration:
> The paper uses IPUMS Terra data. IPUMS-Terra does not allow for redistribution, except for the purpose of replication archives. Permissions as per https://terra.ipums.org/citation have been obtained, and are documented within the "data/IPUMS-terra" folder.

#### Example for confidential data: 
> The data for this project are confidential, but may be obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Researchers interested in access to the data may contact [NAME] at [EMAIL], also see www.doe.mass.edu/research/contact.html. It can take some months to negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication.

#### Example for code during the editorial process
> Code for data cleaning and analysis is provided as part of the replication package. It is available at https://dropbox.com/link/to/code/XYZ123ABC for review. It will be uploaded to the [JOURNAL REPOSITORY] once the paper has been conditionally accepted.

#### Example for code for publication
> Code for data cleaning and analysis is provided as part of the replication package. It is available at https://doi.org/10.xxxx/path/to/journal/archive.

(Note the difference with the temporary Dropbox location during the review process, and the permanent location at publication time.)

#### Example for code that is already available
> All code for data cleaning and analysis associated with the current submission is available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.400356. Any updates will also be published on Zenodo, and the final DOI cited in the manuscript.
