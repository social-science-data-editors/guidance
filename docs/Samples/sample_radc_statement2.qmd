## Sample Statement for Restricted Access Data 2

Below is a sample statement that can be used for data accessible through restricted-access environments. The example is given for a  [specific paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdw057), but should be adaptable to most projects:

> To reproduce the tables and figures in the paper:
> 1. All the results in the paper use confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. To gain access to the Census microdata, follow the directions here on how to write a proposal for access to the data via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center:
https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/howtoapply.html.
>2. You must request the following datasets in your proposal:
>   - Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), 2002 and 2007
>   - Foreign Trade Database – Import (IMP), 2002 and 2007
>   - Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), including the Computer Network Use      Supplement (CNUS), 1999
>   - [...] (LIST ALL DATASETS AS THEY APPEAR ON YOUR PROJECT APPROVAL)
>   - Annual Survey of Magical Inputs (ASMI), 2002 and 2007
>3. Reference “[TITLE OF YOUR PAPER]” by [AUTHORS], project number [SPECIFIC PROJECT NUMBER] in the proposal. This will give you access to   the programs and input datasets required to reproduce the results. 
> [OPTIONALLY] Requesting a search of archives with the article's DOI should yield the same results. [NOTE: In order for this to work, create a directory with the article's DOI!]
>
>   NOTE: Project-related files are available for [XX - typically 10] years as of [DATE OF PUBLICATION].
