... although some are not frequently asked, but might nevertheless be useful. Below questions and answers in random order.

### Do I need to release my entire code history?

> We work on github already. Is there anyway to make just a "release" public in github without making public the entire code history and issue tickets? 

It all depends if you are comfortable with that, and if this is one paper out of multiple ones stemming from the same project.

If not, then what I suggest is to do the following

- clean up the repo (possibly in a branch)
- on Github, there is no way to fork to your own space, and a fork would carry the entire history anyway. So this assumes manual interaction (I'm going to assume you use the command line for this, this works in git-bash, or bash on Linux/OSX).
- create a new clone of your (now cleaned) repo, and switch to the clean branch
   ```
   git clone (WHATEVER)
   cd whatever
   git branch "cleaned"
   ```

- now wipe out all git information:
   ```
   rm -rf .git
   ```

- create a new repo
   ```
   git init
   ```

- Add all files
   ```
   git add *
   ```

 (careful with subdirs)

- Push to a new Github repo
  - (on Github, create an empty repo, then push to it)
  - (if using the Github Desktop, instead "add existing repo" to the Github Desktop, then push to Github.com)
- Now enable this new repo for the [Zenodo integration](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
- Create a release
  - This is now your submission release, cleaned of all history and issues
- Cite the DOI of your replication archive in your main text.

### My repo is complex - I only want to share a portion 

Scenario: Author keeps several papers related to an ongoing or long-running project in a single repo, and wants to isolate code for tidy submission alongside an "offshoot paper".

In this case, it has been suggested to use the `git filter-branch` approach, which is essentially a way to split off a subset of a repo into a new repo (e.g. a subdirectory paper-1). It will conveniently inherit the commit history as well (but see above if that is not desired). See guide at [https://help.github.com/en/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository).

### Data Citation without Online Link
> Do you have any examples of data citation for proprietary data that does not have an online link? All the examples are much more formal than the random spreadsheets [agency 1]  sent over! [agency 2] has a more formal naming system, but again, there's no persistent indicator for the datasets because they are not accessible.

A known problem with no clear solution. Here's how I try to approach the problem:

 - A citation has author, title, and a publisher, with optional other locators. (see [Chicago Manual of Style (subscription)](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part3/ch14/psec014.html) and [CMS Quick Guide on citations](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html). 
 
Note that Chicago-style does not actually require the locator information - see the examples for "E-book" Kindle.
 
> "Electronic content presented without formal ties to a publisher or sponsoring body has the authority equivalent to that of unpublished or self-published material in other media."

Thus, one can construct the citation as
    - Author: the provider of the data (the agency)
    - Title: whatever the provider would recognize and re-furnish to a third-party
    - Publisher: the provider of the data (or its higher-level institution, e.g., the government department or ministry)
    - Locators (optional): maybe something along the lines of "Multiple electronic files" with possible additional information ", provided to the author under DUA (date or any contract number)"

An example might thus be:

> Agency 1. 2007. *Name of DataSet*. Boston: Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Multiple electronic files.

### The URL works for me. Why are you complaining that it is not robust/persistent/permanent?

This may happen for both data files and documents by non-standard publishers. We explain what this means, and various ways to deal with it.

A URL is simply a locator for a file on the internet. However, they are not all created equal. In particular, files on sites from anything other than robust institutions (archives, journals, newspapers) should be considered to be *transitory*: here today, gone tomorrow. This often applies to even big companies that are not in the business of publishing with the goal of long-term preservation. It also includes URLs that obviously point to storage providers: Dropbox.com, Google Drive, AWS, Github.io, etc. 

For instance, the file `https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.upl/nwica.org/unitedstates2014.pdf` is hosted on Amazon AWS, a commercial provider, presumably by the website of NWICA (`nwica.org`). If tomorrow NWICA decides to change suppliers for their webservices, and migrates their website `nwica.org` to the site of `myhoster.com`, that URL will change. What is less likely to change is the original "landing page" from which "unitedstates2014.pdf" could be downloaded, though that can also change a few years from now. For preservation, the PDF could be copied onto an institution whose business it is to preserve files, such as Zenodo, or Archive.org, where it becomes "permanently" available (or at least at much longer).

#### Solutions

- Third-best: Cite the original landing page, with an access date, as any other URL on the web:

> NWICA. 2015. "How WIC Impacts the People of the United States of America." Accessed at https://nwica.org/documents/unitedstates2014/ on August 2, 2017. 

and provide a copy of the file, if copyright and license permit. 

- Second-best: Use [Archive.org's Save a Page feature](https://web.archive.org/) to make a copy of the file, and then cite the stable URL thus generated. 

> NWICA. 2015. "How WIC Impacts the People of the United States of America." Accessed via Archive.org at https://web.archive.org/web/20200205043504/https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.upl/nwica.org/unitedstates2014.pdf on February 4, 2020.

- First-best: Ask the publisher to provide a stable URL. 

### Data Citation with only a top-level Online Link

Many databases with an online interface make it hard to find an easy-to-cite URL. Nevertheless, a few clicks can often show a referenceable URL. A few examples follow.

#### OECD Statistics
The top-level URL is [https://stats.oecd.org/](https://stats.oecd.org/), and (almost) never changes. However, the [User Guide](https://stats.oecd.org/Content/themes/OECD/static/help/WBOS%20User%20Guide%20(EN).PDF?page=34), page 34, shows how to share a URL for a particular query. The usual citation rules for URLs then can be applied.
