Inter alia, this policy requests that authors provide accurate and persistent information about how other researchers can find and access data, whether that data be created by the authors or by third parties. Elements of such information are persistent URLs or Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), description of access conditions, and terms of use.\nOne of our authors has used your data, and we are inquiring about any such information you could provide either to us or to authors upon request. We are looking for\n\nDOI for specific datasets or files\nURLs or DOI pointing to licenses (or, if the files are license-free, a statement to that effect)\nURLs or DOI pointing to terms of use - the conditions under which researchers may use and possibly republish the data (this may be the same as the license)\nURLs, DOI, or information regarding how long you will maintain the datasets you make available\n\nIf you have such information available, we would be grateful if you could point us in the right direction. If you do not yet have such information, any plans you might have would be of interest to us.\nThis is a new initiative at the AEA, and we understand that historically, much of what we are looking for above was not part of standard practice in our research community.

If you have an example to suggest for this page, send an email to dataeditor@aeaweb.org or create a pull request.\n\nIPUMS\nIPUMS data are subject to varying usage restrictions. You can find a comprehensive overview of the distribution restrictions at https://ipums.org/about/terms, please consult with IPUMS directly (at ipums@umn.edu) should you have any doubts.\nIPUMS USA Registration page states &gt; IPUMS USA data are available free of charge.

All the results in the paper use confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. To gain access to the Census microdata, follow the directions here on how to write a proposal for access to the data via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center: https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/howtoapply.html. 2. You must request the following datasets in your proposal: - Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), 2002 and 2007 - Foreign Trade Database – Import (IMP), 2002 and 2007 - Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), including the Computer Network Use Supplement (CNUS), 1999 - […] - Annual Survey of Magical Inputs (ASMI), 2002 and 2007 3. Reference “Technology and Production Fragmentation: Domestic versus Foreign Sourcing” by Teresa Fort, project number br1179 in the proposal. This will give you access to the programs and input datasets required to reproduce the results. Requesting a search of archives with the articles DOI (“10.1093/restud/rdw057”) should yield the same results.\nNOTE: Project-related files are available for 10 years as of 2015.\n\nSample (unofficial) citations for Census Bureau datasets in the FSRDC can be found on Zotero.org and on Github.\nIn cases where intermediate files (programs or datasets) remain within the secure environment, an authorization (a “license”) might be added to the DCAS. Such an authorization by the author grants others access to and use of such files, subject to any data custodian requirements.\n\nExample of a author granting license for files in secure environment.\n\n\n\nNBER-CES Manufacturing Database\nThe NBER-CES Manufactuing Database does not have an explicit license. It may be in the public domain, since U.S. Government employees co-created it as part of their official duties. Nevertheless, the database should be cited, as well as the working paper associated with it.\nThe files should be cited as “NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (1958-2011)”. You should also cite the earlier working paper as documentation. Please cite these in the manuscript. As per the NBER website,\n\n“We ask that this data not be forwarded on to others. Instead, please refer interested parties to this website.”\n\n\n\nTAXSIM\nTAXSIM is maintained by Daniel Feenberg at the NBER. Those who use its output should probably cite Daniel Feenberg as the author. Note citation request on URL referenced:\n\n\nFeenberg, Daniel Richard, and Elizabeth Coutts, An Introduction to the TAXSIM Model, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management vol 12 no 1, Winter 1993, pages 189-194.\n\n\n\n\nThis paper and this URL (https://www.nber.org/~taxsim) should be cited if any results from TAXSIM are circulated or published.\n\n\n\n\nState or Provincial Data Access\nThe following example is for Massachusetts, but similar data availability statements may be crafted for various other datasets provided by state, provincial, municipal, etc. data providers:\n\nThe data for this project are confidential, but may be obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Researchers interested in access to the data may contact [NAME] at [EMAIL], also see www.doe.mass.edu/research/contact.html.

    "text": "From the Econometric Society Data Editor’s FAQ\nExtracted from https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/es-data-editor-website/FAQs\n\nIf my restricted-access data provider has a public use testing sample available, can I provide this sample instead of a simulated/synthetic dataset?\nIf a public use testing sample is available, it is generally preferred over a simulated/synthetic dataset (but less preferred than providing temporary access to the original data) as long as the testing sample can be published with your replication package. If the sample cannot be published, it is advisable to provide a simulated/synthetic dataset that can be included in the package.\n\n\nWhat is the procedure followed by the Econometric Society if I supply simulated/synthetic datasets?\nIn the case of simulated or synthetic datasets, they will be published along with the replication package. Although these datasets may not represent the actual data, their structure is designed to closely mimic the original dataset, providing readers with a better understanding of the data used. You must ensure that the manipulation process used to create the synthetic/simulated datasets is clearly described in the README file.\n\n\nWhy am I requested to supply simulated/synthetic data?\nWhen reproducibility checks cannot be performed on real data, running these checks on simulated/synthetic datasets still offers advantages. They help verify the completeness, self-contained nature, and error-free execution of the code. For future users of the package, it also allows them to run the codes and learn from them.\n\n\nMy article estimates a non-linear model, and the algorithm does not converge with randomly generated data. What should I do?\nIn such cases, it is strongly recommended to simulate data using your model as the data generating process. If that is not feasible, it is important to contact the Data Editor and provide a detailed explanation of why this is the case. The Data Editor will assist you in finding a suitable solution and may propose alternative approaches to handle the situation to your managing co-editor.\n\n\nHow do I decide whether to produce a simulated or a synthetic dataset?\nTo generate a dataset that closely resembles the original data, the synthetic option may be easier to implement. There are various open-source routines available that can assist in this process. However, consider two main disadvantages: (i) one needs to ensure proper anonymization of the data when using a scrambling/perturbation algorithm, and (ii) non-linear estimation routines may face convergence challenges when applied to synthetic data, whereas artificial datasets generated by the model being estimated are more likely to converge.",

    "section": "GIS data files",
    "text": "GIS data files\nOne of the most commonly used geospatial data formats is a set of files collectively referred to as a “shapefile”. These are often distributed as ZIP archives, but for any given project, are generally within a separate directory. There are at least three mandatory files, ending in shp, shx, and dbf. The shp file contains the vector geometries (points, lines, polygons) that appear on a map (“features”). The dbf is an attribute table (in dBase IV format), and can be created and manipulated by other programs as well, including Stata, R, and Python. The shx file is an index that links the geometries to the corresponding attribute data. There are several other optional sidecar files that should be retained, if present. For example, a .prj file defines the projection, or coordinate system of the geometries. Shapefiles have notable technical limitations (such as 10-character attribute names, 254-character text field values, 255 attribute limit, and 2GB file size) but the format is well-understood and widely implemented.\nGeospatial data also comes in many other formats. GeoPackage is a modern GIS data standard that overcomes many of the shapefile limitations, and is now widely supported. Like the shapefile, it supports vector data, but GeoPackage can also contain raster (pixel-based) data. The most widely-used raster data format is GeoTIFF, but large, multi-dimensional datasets are often shared in NetCDF format.\nNon-geospatial tabular data is often combined with geospatial data for analysis. CSV is recommended as a well-known format. Geospatial point data may also be shared in CSV format, with the inclusion of two fields for the X and Y coordinates. Longitude and latitude is often used for global datasets, but there are hundreds of local coordinate systems in common use, so be sure to document the coordinate system being used.",

For instance, some shapefiles in the US will be sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, which uses them for various statistical activities. These sources should be clearly outlined.\nAny processing to combine data in preparation of creating a map, as well as the processing steps to create the map, need to be described in a reproducible workflow.",

These models can effectively turn a complex flow into something that looks like just another processing tool, so that the same model can be run on another input, or with different starting parameters. There may be some variations in the format between ArcGIS software versions that should be investigated when considering their use for reproducibility. Models can also be exported to a Python script, which might be better from a reproducibility perspective, although they will still depend on access to licensed ArcGIS python libraries in order to run. It is also possible to write ArcPy scripts by hand.\nEsri’s newer ArcGIS Pro (as opposed to the older ArcMap) has “ArcGIS Notebooks” which are based on Jupyter.\nHowever, it seems many Esri users are still using the older ArcMap.\n\nResources\nEsri Academy has many ArcGIS tutorials and web courses.

    "text": "Sometimes, it is worthwhile to not convolute a particular useful dataset within a replication package. Pulling it out, depositing it in its own right, is easy, and yields much greater findability through search engines such as ICPSR or Google Dataset Search.\nThe approach is relatively simple.\n\nChoose a repository\nChoose any one of the open trusted repositories (see our document on data and code hosting). You want to maximize findability, but also credit.\nNotes:\n\nFor US government data, datalumos.org is a site that “rescues” data, but it obfuscates a bit the contribution of the author.\n\nFor instance, I deposited this data at datalumos.org: but my contribution is not visible. It might be possible to add your name to the “Collection Notes” or similar. Not ideal.\nGenerically, you can achieve great findability of Census Bureau data by using one of the ICPSR properties, in this case probably openICPSR (similar to, but distinct from your AEA deposit).\n\nSome examples are given in our document on data and code hosting.\nIf you are at an ICPSR member institution, or have a forthcoming paper in the AEA journals, you may submit to ICPSR, including leveraging the expertise of their professional data curation team.\n\n\n\nDeposit the data and fill out metadata\n\nFill out the title and other things.\n\nChoose a title that emulates the title for the official (digital-first). For instance, if you were to deposit historical files for the U.S. Economic Census, you would emulate Census Bureau publications, either per year (1987 Economic Census) or collected (Historical Economic Census).\n\nBe sure to add yourself as the “Principal Investigator”\nFill out as much as you can about the metadata.\nFor “Collection Notes”, describe accurately where the files come from, and what you did to them to make them usable.\nIf you still have them, also upload the original formats, in addition to any converted files.\n\n\n\nGoing an additional extra mile\n\nIf you wish, check with one of the data librarians at your institution to dot the is and cross the ts.\n\n\n\nAdd related publication\nIf the chosen repository allows to do this, add your own publication (which uses and/or documents the data) as a related publication.\n\n\nHit publish.

    "text": "Trusted Repositories\nJournals and institutions have assessed a number of trusted repositories:\n\nCoreTrustSeal has a certification process\nre3data.org lists research data repositories\nNature, F1000Research, and PLOS have lists of trusted repositories.\nAlways check with your journal for specific restrictions or suggestions.\nThese generally include at least the following:\n\nDryad Digital Repository\nfigshare\nHarvard Dataverse\nICPSR and OPENICPSR\nOpen Science Framework\nZenodo\nCountry or region-specific repositories (that nevertheless generally accept depositors from anywhere): GESIS (Germany), Swedish National Data Service (SND), EASY (Netherlands), CSIRO (Australia), etc.\n\nMany universities have formal document repositories that may be able to assume such a role; talk to your (data) librarian\nRestricted-access and secure data centers also assume the role of trusted repositories:\n\ne.g. Federal Statistical Research Data Centers for a variety of statistical microdata in the US\ne.g. Cornell Restricted Access Data Center (CRADC) for an example of a campus-wide secure data center and archive\ne.g. Centre d’accès sécurisé aux données (CASD) for an example of a European equivalent of the FSRDCs\ne.g. Health Care Cost Institute for an example of an industry-based data center for research\n\nNote that some data archives can also handle restrictions on data dissemination for various reasons\n\nICPSR can handle certain types of confidential data\nZenodo can handle license-based restricted access\n\nWe note that acceptable access restrictions are limited to concerns of confidentiality or third-party licensing. We do not accept (permanent) access restrictions where\n\nthe author is the sole arbitrar of access\nsharing is not allowed because of personal interests (future publications, patents, etc.)\n\n\n\nList of Additional Acceptable Trusted Repositories in Economics\nA list of trusted repositories that have been found to be acceptable for the purpose of archiving social and economic data can be found here:\nhttps://social-science-data-editors.github.io/reference/TrustedRepositories.html\nThe list is maintained by the editors collaborating on this site. To suggest an addition, please issue a pull request, or email one of the editors.\n\n\nPermanent Identifiers: Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) et al\nA sufficient, but not necessary criterion for a “trusted repository” is the assignment of permanent identifiers, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOI).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR30261.v6\n\nSome repositories (often university-based) ones will also assign handles:\n\nhttps://hdl.handle.net/1813/45789\n\nOthers assign DOI upon demand. We generally suggest requesting a DOI if possible. Examples:\n\nOn OSF, users can request DOIs for projects\nOn university repositories, request procedures may look like this page at Cornell University\n\nHowever, care must be taken when using permanent identifiers: the URL in the address bar is (almost) never the same as the DOI or handle. All permanent identifiers are redirects: they constitute a permanent entry that points to wherever the most recent version of the object can be found:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR30261.v6 is a DOI that redirects to https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/30261 (as of June 2020).\nhttps://hdl.handle.net/1813/45789 is a handle that redirects to https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/45789\n\nOnly the first entry in each of the examples above should be used for citing, not the second.\n\n\nNOT ACCEPTABLE\nA variety of (unfortunately) commonly used web-accessible locations are not acceptable as data repositories for the purpose of an article’s supplementary materials:\n\nGithub, Gitlab, etc. because a project’s owner can delete a git repository at any time (but see this page on how to leverage Zenodo to enable proper archiving of code and software) (see also questions in the FAQ);\nGoogle pages, university and personal faculty web pages - they can all be deleted by the owner or by the employer (the university) without regards to archival characteristics of its contents (but talk to your university library - they may have a way to facilitate archiving of web pages - and investigate the Wayback Machine for a similar purpose);\nDropbox, Box.com, and similar cloud-based data and file sharing services - again, they can all be deleted at short notice, or when payment stops\n\n\n\n\nSome good examples\n\n“Immigration Restrictions as Active Labor Market Policy: Evidence from the Mexican Bracero Exclusion, Replication files and raw data” (Michael Clemens)\n\nHosted on Harvard Dataverse at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/bracero\nContains two datasets:\n\nClemens, Michael, 2017, “Raw scanned PDFs of primary sources for workers, wages, and crops”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DJHVHB, Harvard Dataverse, V1\nClemens, Michael, 2018, “Replication Data for: Immigration Restrictions as Active Labor Market Policy: Evidence from the Mexican Bracero Exclusion”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/17M4ZP, Harvard Dataverse, V1\n\n\n\n\n“United States Newspaper Panel, 1869-2004” (Gentzkow, Shapiro, Sinkinson)\n\nHosted on ICPSR at https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/30261\nContains\n\nGentzkow, Matthew, Shapiro, Jesse M., and Sinkinson, Michael.

Subsequently handle it equivalently to the general code guidance, but make special note (placeholders, explanatory text) of any redacted information.\nIn addition, some RADC may provide the ability to deposit code internally and confidentially. Use such interal repositories, and make a note of their location in the publicly deposited code or in supplementary documents.\n\n\n\nSelf-generated repositories (second best)\nIf a RADC has at least an archival or backup policy of sufficient length (e.g., 10 or more years), but does not offer a formal repository, then the following procedure allows users to find and request code and data - As before, request as much code as is feasible, and deposit it in a public repository (e.g., openICPSR, Dataverse, Zenodo). Don’t publish it yet. - If possible at such repositories, pre-register a DOI - At Zenodo: click the appropriation request button, and a DOI will be assigned, e.g., 10.5281/zenodo.NNNNN. - At openICPSR: projects are called openicpsr-NNNNN. The DOI is derived from the project number as 10.3886/ENNNNNV1. - If you already have a DOI assigned to your manuscript or (published) paper, you can alternatively use that (see 10.1093/restud/rdw057 for an excellent example). - In the RADC, create a two-level directory with the name of the DOI. - Move both data (following guidelines outlined here) and all code (not just the confidential part) to subdirectories. The resulting directory structure will look something like this:\n/some/path/project/10.5281/zenodo.NNNNN/:\n      data/original/rawdata.dta\n      data/derived/analysis.dta\n      programs/01_cleaning.do\n      programs/02_analysis.do\n\nConfirm with the RADC’s administrative staff how long project files are kept as archives or in backup (often 5-10 years)\nAdd a statement to the public README.md (and to article materials). See Sample RADC Statement 1 and Sample RADC Statement 2.\n\n\n\nSome examples\n\nFort (2016) 10.1093/restud/rdw057, in the supplementary materials (local copy)\nGroen, Kutzbach, and Polivka (2019, forthcoming) (link to be supplied upon publication)\nSee also section on Data and Code Availability Statements.",

    "text": "Overview\nWe request the following information from all articles:\n\nData Description: detailed description of all data, including input data:\n\nname of data set\n(original and current) location of data set - this is also called the “provenance” of the data\ncharacteristics of data set: At a minimum, all variables that are used in the paper should be well-described (variable/column labels, value labels, summary statistics).\n\nData Access: complete description of how the data can be accessed\nData Persistence: how long will the data continue to exist in the form the author used it\n\nDetails follow.\n\n\nGeneric Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\nsubgraph \"Data Provider\";\nDB[(Data source)] ;\nend;\nDB -.- E&gt;Extract] -.-&gt; A;\nsubgraph Researcher;\nA((Input data)) --&gt; B{Further analysis};\nend;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData description\n\nData citation:\n\nThis must include the official name of the dataset (might be “Data source” or “Input data” in the figure above), as well as the name of the creator (“Data Provider” in the figure above)\n\nincluding if the article’s author is the creator\n\nIt must include the location of the data - download site, physical archive, etc.\n\nIf the data is original to the article, then this will be an integral part of the replication archive\nIf the data was acquired elsewhere, this should be the ORIGINAL location of the data (“Data Source” in the figure above)\n\nIt must include the date the data was created or downloaded\nIf possible, provide a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).\n\nYou can generate a citation from the DOI using https://www.doi2bib.org/.\nFor information on how and where to deposit data in places that generate a DOI, see our Data and Hosting guidance\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more detailed information, see Data citation guidance.\n\n\n\nStatistical characteristics of the data\nThis description of data is often called “metadata”\n\nAt a minimum, all variables that are used in the paper should be well-described (variable/column labels, value labels, summary statistics) through a codebook.\nIf this information is already provided in the article or an online appendix, the README should point to it (“For summary statistics of variables, see Table 1 in the paper”). Note however that the human-readable variable name (e.g. “Earnings”) still needs to be mapped to the name in the dataset, if different (e.g., “var31a”)\nIf confidentiality protection is a concern,\n\ntalk to your data provider.\nYou may be able to apply simple count and fraction rounding rules (see code in this Github repository), or remove some summary statistics (e.g., max/min or specific quantiles).\nFor additional guidance, see\n\n\nWhere multiple versions of the data exist, describe the version of the data used by the author.\nThis information can be generated by the paper author, or provided by pointing to a URL of the data provider (for instance an online codebook).\n\n\nPractical guidance: Data description\nIt doesn’t need to be complicated, but should be complete. For more extensive descriptions, best practices, and possible support, see - ICSPR, “Guide to Social Science Data Preparation and Archiving: Phase 3: Data Collection and File Creation” - DataONE Primer on Data Management Best Practices - Yale Institution for Social and Policy Studies - Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research - World Bank DIME Checklist\nOther services may be available at your own institution. Some services may charge a fee, or only be available to researchers affiliated with that institution.\nWe provide a few suggestions for how to do this in Stata, R, and SAS. However, if you have the ability to do a more robust data description, you should. See a self-citing example.\n\n\n\nData access description\nThe description of data access should provide enough information so that an uninformed user could theoretically access the data. Data access descriptions are often referred to as “Data Availability Statements”.\n\nIn the flow diagram above, it is the answer to the question: Who can access “Data Source” at “Data Provider” and create an extract.\n\nThe access should be persistent, i.e., not rely on a transitory website or the presence of a particular person who might change jobs at any time.\n\nThis can be as simple as a download URL.\nIt might be a pointer to a directory in the replication archive.\nThis might also be the URL for a description of the application procedure (dataprovider.com/application_procedure.html). Real examples include\n\nNCHS, https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/leftbrch/userestricdt.htm ,\nPSID https://simba.isr.umich.edu/restricted/ProcessReq.aspx)\n\nThe access description should include an estimate of the monetary and time cost of the application process.\nIf you provided a Data Management Plan (DMP) as part of a grant proposal, much of the information may already be present in the DMP.\nProvide the date when the data access description was valid. For long-running projects, this may be the information when YOU accessed the data, or it may be the access information for somebody who wants to access the data TODAY.\nProvide information on the access conditions:\n\nThis is often defined within a license.\nOpen-access data is often under a Creative Commons - Attribution (CC-BY) license.\nIf any license is posted or stated, link to it.\nTerms of use and license are not exactly the same thing.\nDoes a downloader need to agree to simple terms of use? (Example: IPUMS-USA https://usa.ipums.org/usa/cite.shtml)\nDoes the researcher need to provide information (project proposal, computer security plan, etc.)? (Example: PSID https://simba.isr.umich.edu/U/CondUse.aspx)\nIs there perhaps a residency or citizen requirement?\n\n\n\nPractical guidance: data access\n\nWhile non-academic data providers may not always consider reproducibility when you sign a contract with them, we have found numerous such providers which are open to at least the idea of “reproducibility checking” or replication. Examples of agreements which allow third-parties to access confidential data for the purpose of replication,\n\nsupplementary materials to Barseghyan et al (2013) (in particular the data-user-agreements.pdf).\n\nFor additional guidance on licensing, see Licensing guidance.\nFor more information on Data Access Descriptions, see Data Access Descriptions.\n\nFor additional sample “Data Access Descriptions”, see\n\nthe Template README\nJournal of Applied Econometrics’ Data Archive.\n\n\n\n\nData persistence\nData should remain available for a sufficiently long time.\n\nBy depositing in the journal-based data (and code) repositories, the data (and code) will remain available indefinitely.\nThis is also true if the data is in various other repositories\nThis may also be true if the data cannot be shared (restricted access data).\nAgain, this may already have been defined in your DMP.\nA good minimum benchmark is 10 years, but this may not always be feasible with data the author does not control. You should describe the data persistence, or point to a data archive’s policy in that matter.\n\n\nSee Requested_information_hosting for more details on data repositories.\n\n\n\nWhat is a data provider\nA “data provider” in this sense can be - a public repository where the data can be found (ICPSR), - a website that provided the data (IPUMS), - a statistical agency or private company that granted access to the data (U.S. Census Bureau, Twitter, Acme Inc.).\nThe author may also be the data provider, for instance, because the author conducted the survey used in the article. However, in many cases, the data provider may not be a data archive (see the page on Requested information about hosting).\n\nPractical guidance: data provider and data archives\nIf the data provider is not an archive (i.e., the data persistence is insufficient, and data might go away), you should investigate depositing the data at a data archive.\n\n\n\nPlanning Ahead\nMany of the items above can be planned ahead of time. In fact, funding agencies require data management plans, and these are core elements of data management plans. - ICPSR, “Guidelines for Effective Data Management Plans”\nConsider from the start what is needed to share the data. - ICPSR, “Guide to Social Science Data Preparation and Archiving Phase 5: Preparing Data for Sharing” If planning to use restricted-access data (private, commmercial, confidential data), consider asking the provider about their support of replication exercises.\nIf collecting data, consider early on the need to have just enough restrictions. - ICPSR, “Recommended Informed Consent Language for Data Sharing” - EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Language on consent\nConsider breaking your data archives into manageable pieces. For instance, raw data might be in a different location/repository/archive than the analysis data, even if you are providing access to both for the purpose of replication.

Authors should consult with a qualified party, such as a university counsel or a lawyer, as appropriate.\n\n\nDefault\nWhen depositing in a Code and Data Repository, a license needs to be chosen. If not chosen through the menu, a license file (typically named LICENSE.txt or LICENSE.md) needs to be provided.\n\n\nSome guidance on licensing of databases and software:\n\nCornell’s Research Data Management Service Group\nStodden, Victoria. “Enabling Reproducible Research: Open Licensing For Scientific Innovation”, International Journal of Communications Law and Policy, Issue 13, 2009.\nBitlaw.com, “Database Legal Protection, accessed at https://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/database.html#compilations on Sept 12, 2019.\n\nFor the purpose of replicability, journals will usually insist on an open license that allows for replication by researchers unconnected to the original parties, to the extent allowed by other agreements and the law. - For data-only repositories, possible licenses include the  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License or the more liberal  [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication] - For code-only repositories, possible licenses include  3-Clause (Modified) BSD Clause, though other open-source licenses are equally acceptable (see https://opensource.org/licenses). “Code” or “Software” is any statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result, and may include interpretive, object or source code. The CC-BY license is not recommended for software.\n\n\nDual-License Setup\nMany repositories contain both code and databases. In that case, the repository might contain files under different licenses. For instance, some components may come with more restrictive licenses (MIT License for software from third parties) or more lenient licenses (CC0 license for own code), with a third license for databases.\n\nDual-license Example\nThe AEA provides an example of a dual-license setup, suitable for use by depositors to various journals’ data and code repositories (see the LICENSE-template). It combines\n\n Modified BSD License, applies to all code, scripts, programs, and SOFTWARE\n Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License, applies to databases, images, tables, text, and any other objects\n\n\n\nMulti-license Example\nIn the example below, drawn from Greenelab, the specific types of files are identified by “glob patterns” or regular expressions, but explicit naming of files or directories could also be applied.\n \n\nExcept when noted otherwise, the entirety of this repository is licensed under a CC BY 4.0 License (LICENSE.md), which allows reuse with attribution.\n\n\nSince CC BY is not ideal for code and data, certain repository components are also released under the CC0 1.0 public domain dedication (LICENSE-CC0.md). All files matched by the following glob patterns are dual licensed under CC BY 4.0 and CC0 1.0:\n\n\n*.sh\n*.py\n*.yml / *.yaml\n….\n.gitignore\n\n\nAll other files are only available under CC BY 4.0, including:\n\n\n*.md\n*.html\n*.pdf\n*.docx\n\n\nExcept for the following files with different licenses:\n\n\nbuild/assets/anchors.js which is released under an MIT License",

    "text": "This may happen for both data files and documents by non-standard publishers. We explain what this means, and various ways to deal with it.\nA URL is simply a locator for a file on the internet. However, they are not all created equal. In particular, files on sites from anything other than robust institutions (archives, journals, newspapers) should be considered to be transitory: here today, gone tomorrow. This often applies to even big companies that are not in the business of publishing with the goal of long-term preservation. It also includes URLs that obviously point to storage providers: Dropbox.com, Google Drive, AWS, Github.io, etc.\nFor instance, the file https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.upl/nwica.org/unitedstates2014.pdf is hosted on Amazon AWS, a commercial provider, presumably by the website of NWICA (nwica.org). If tomorrow NWICA decides to change suppliers for their webservices, and migrates their website nwica.org to the site of myhoster.com, that URL will change. What is less likely to change is the original “landing page” from which “unitedstates2014.pdf” could be downloaded, though that can also change a few years from now. For preservation, the PDF could be copied onto an institution whose business it is to preserve files, such as Zenodo, or Archive.org, where it becomes “permanently” available (or at least at much longer).\n\nSolutions\n\nThird-best: Cite the original landing page, with an access date, as any other URL on the web:\n\n\nNWICA. 2015. “How WIC Impacts the People of the United States of America.” Accessed at https://nwica.org/documents/unitedstates2014/ on August 2, 2017.\n\nand provide a copy of the file, if copyright and license permit.\n\nSecond-best: Use Archive.org’s Save a Page feature to make a copy of the file, and then cite the stable URL thus generated.\n\n\nNWICA. 2015. “How WIC Impacts the People of the United States of America.” Accessed via Archive.org at https://web.archive.org/web/20200205043504/https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.upl/nwica.org/unitedstates2014.pdf on February 4, 2020.\n\n\nFirst-best: Ask the publisher to provide a stable URL."

    "text": "First, all sharing - whether privately with us, or publicly through the data publication process - should be in compliance with all IRB rules, data use agreements, etc. We will never ask you to share data that you do not have the right to share with us or anybody else.\nSecond, there is a difference between sharing with us, and publishing the data. We can accept private data sharing for the purpose of replication, conduct our reproducibility checks, and delete the data provided. You are in control of the publication of any data (though it has happened that we have had to point out to authors that they do not, in fact, have the rights to publish data that they were going to publish).\nThird, the inability to publish the data does not absolve you from creating an archive of the data as it was used for the article. This archive, for private/confidential/proprietary data, should remain private - on your own systems, or appropriate university archives. But it must exist, so that you can reliably answer queries from authors in future years.\nHow should you proceed?\nThe best way to think of this is as a set of layers. Your working directory WD, from which you derived the tables and figures in the paper, is composed of confidential data CD, non-confidential data NCD, and programs/code P (and possibly temporary files TF). So WD = CD + NCD + P + TF. For the purpose of replication archives, you should create two archives:\n\nA.zip : contains NCD and P\nB.zip : contains CD\n\nYou should then test: create an empty directory, unpack the two archives, and verify that they are sufficient:\n\n(unzip A.zip) + (unzip B.zip) == NCD + P + CD == WD - TF\n\nYou should then import A.zip into the openICPSR archive, and ensure that B.zip is properly and securely archived, in compliance with all rules that you are subject to.\nYou can provide B.zip to us for the purpose of replication, but B.zip would not be published.\n\nHow can I ensure that the confidential data is preserved?\nThe ideal promise that has the highest credibility is a commitment from the provider of the confidential data to maintain the data for a number of years.\nA second-best solution requires that you inspect your data use agreement. Can you archive the data in a robust fashion (using whatever tools your university has)? Some DUA allow for that, others don’t. The promise then becomes that you/your university will guarantee persistence of the data for X years.\nA better variant of that is when the DUA allows you to share the data with others that have also demonstratably signed a DUA with the provider. The data provider controls the access, you (your archive) provides the data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Journals offer guidance on citation, you may want to check there first. The guidance provided here is in addition, and may be the basis for future official guidance.\n\nData Citations\nProperly referencing data goes beyond just reproducibility - it is also proper scientific writing style. In the same way that authors use bibliographic references to “printed” resources, they should also be using such references for data resources, to give and receive credit where credit is due. Not referencing an article or book is at best an oversight, and at worst plagiarism - and the same should apply to data objects. Numerous guides and tutorials exist, some of which provide a variety of examples.\n\nDataONE Tutorial on Data Citation and generic guidance\nICPSR\nForce11’s Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principals\nthe AEA’s Sample References\nMichigan State University\nUC Santa Cruz\nOSF\n\n\n\nWhat to cite\nIn a nutshell, every dataset is to be cited. This is true for the main article as well as online appendices. In the past, use of data or code has been acknowledged in footnotes, and only rarely through bibliographic references. However, if the dataset is used, it should appear in the bibliography. The same is true for code reused from previous papers, or provided by authors.\n\n\nWhat not to cite\nIt has been long-standing convention in economics to cite a paper describing the data, but not the data themselves. This is inconsistent with other citation practices, in addition to not being compliant with the Data Citation Principles. In principle, it is simple:\n\nIf you use the data, you cite the data. If you reference the document, you cite the document. But you don’t cite the document when using the data.\n\nIt is worthwhile to point out that we don’t cite the book review when wanting to reference what an author said in a book. We cite the book directly. This is the literature analog to data citations.\n\nData are published\nThe DOI is thus public, and all repositories will provide a suggested citation. One can also use https://www.doi2bib.org/ or https://citation.crosscite.org/ to get a citation (see below for additional tools).\n\n\nData are not published\nThis is trickier. The data does not necessarily have a title that is related to the paper. Some repositories allow authors to “reserve” a DOI (Zenodo) or to delay publication. For some repositories, the DOI, while not officially reserved, can be derived from information already available (see this FAQ for openICPSR, something similar may be possible at Dataverse).\nIn some cases, authors may be able to delay publication, and coordinate it with the publication of the article (openICPSR, possibly Zenodo).\n\n\n\nWhere to cite\nIn all cases, data and code should be cited in the main manuscript. They should also be referenced in the data availability statement (some journals) or the README (other journals).\n\n\nHow to cite\nMany journals in economics require the Chicago style for citations and bibliographies 1. However, the Chicago Style Manual provides few relevant examples for data citations. Applications like Zotero and Mendeley Desktop also do not support data citations robustly, even though the underlying Citation Style Language has had the concept of a “data” entry for several years.\nDataONE suggests content and style that resemble the generic working paper or article citation style (adapted to Chicago style):\n\nWestbrook JW, Kitajima K, Burleigh JG, Kress WJ, Erickson DL, Wright SJ (2011) Data from: What makes a leaf tough? Patterns of correlated evolution between leaf toughness traits and demographic rates among 197 shade-tolerant woody species in a neotropical forest. Dryad Digital Repository. http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8525\n\nICPSR notes that a citation should include the following items: - Title - Author - Date - Version - Persistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)\nand provides a few examples, with some additional modifiers:\n\nEsther Duflo; Rohini Pande, 2006, ``Dams, Poverty, Public Goods and Malaria Incidence in India’’, http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/IOJHHXOOLZ UNF:5:obNHHq1gtV400a4T+Xrp9g== Murray Research Archive [Distributor] V2 [Version]\n\nFinally, the AEA style guide suggests\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968.’’ Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI. ICPSR05404-v1. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404 (accessed February 8, 2011).\n\nThis may be adjusted. An alternate citation may be\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968.’’ Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI. ICPSR05404-v1. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05404.\n\nCitations to primary data can sometimes be hard to construct. If the data provider has a suggested citation, then you should use it. Alternatively, you can construct as per the above examples, for instance, as noted on the AEA style guide:\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” United States Department of Labor. http://data.bls.gov/cgi- bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011).\n\n\n\nSome additional guidance on tricky citations\n\nAdditional guidance on Data Citations.\nData citation without an online link\nSample (unofficial) citations for Census Bureau datasets in the FSRDC can be found on Zotero.org and on Github.\n\n\n\nSome Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen providing data citations, please be sure to check that a URL is given. However, there are some subtleties:\n\nIf only a single file is downloaded from a website, the data citation should include the precise URL (https://data.com/path/to/file), not just a top-level URL (https://data.com)\nIf a URL is giving starting with “https://doi.org”, then it is a DOI. Those do not need access dates. Otherwise, a website access needs a URL (by most citation styles).\nBe sure to provide the DOI when both a DOI and a URL is available. A DOI is stable, a URL may not be.\nAlways check the URL by clicking on it, Sometimes, the URL turns out to be generic/top-level, and does not show the file the replicator should be downloading. The replicator should be able to find the file using the URL, or with the instructions in the README.\n\nCheck for a license/data use agreement.\n\nJust because data is visible does not mean it can be redistributed. By default, it is not (copyright).\nRegardless of redistribution rights, the URL of the data use agreement should be included in the README/online appendix to fully describe data access conditions.\nIdeally, a copy of the data use agreement or license should be included in the replication archive. This can be a copy of an email authorizing you to distribute the data, or a copy of the data use agreement on the website when you downloaded the data (which might be different from the current data use agreement!)\n\nSome data use agreements may also require specific citations (of papers, of code). Verify that you are compliant with all such requirements!\n\nThe same actually applies for Stata or R packages that may be downloaded.\nIt is R practice to cite all packages, and R makes that easy. This should be noted in the report, if not done. Citation in the README should be sufficient.\nIn Stata, some packages have citation requirements. Check the website of the author, sometimes also the *.ado file the author downloads. For instance, many authors use “reghdfe”. See https://github.com/sergiocorreia/reghdfe#citation for a citation requirement.\n\n\n\n\nTools\nNo tool is perfect, but you will likely find the one that works for your particular workflow. Some examples for specific software: - BibTeX - BibLaTeX - Zotero will have native dataset functionality starting in version 5.1, for now, some guidance for entering it can be found in forums. Note that support in the citation styles is also still lacking. - Mendeley Desktop.\n\nTools when the object has a DOI\nThere are several websites that will create a (data) citation from any DOI. Give these a try:\nDOI Citation Formatter at citation.crosscite.org/ is supported by the DOI Registration Agencies. For instance, using 10.3886/ICPSR05404 from the above example, it generates (as of 2022-01-16):\n\nChicago Author-date (16th edition)\n\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1984. “Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945-1968.” ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404.\n\n\nAPA style:\n\n\nLeiss, A. (1984). Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945-1968 [Data set]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05404\n\ndoi2bib at doi2bib.org/ will generate a BibTeX entry from a DOI (for instance from 10.3886/ICPSR05404):\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.3886/icpsr05404,\n  doi = {10.3886/ICPSR05404},\n  url = {http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/5404},\n  author = {Leiss,  Amelia},\n  language = {en},\n  title = {Arms Transfers to Developing Countries,  1945-1968},\n  publisher = {ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research},\n  year = {1984}\n}\n\n\nWhen the object does not have a DOI\nWhen the object does not have a DOI, it isn’t really that much more complicated, but little guidance is available.\n\nCitation Machine - choose Source type=Digital file and put the URL and access date into the Annotation field.\nTry our own tool:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors or Producer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of publication:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistent identifier or URL:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of access:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessed or downloaded?\n\n\n Accessed  Downloaded",

Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2019. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. Twenty-second edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com.\n\n\nNational Hockey League. 2018. NHL Game Database 1917-2018. National Hockey League Hall of Fame, Toronto, ON. Accessed February 29, 2019.\n\n\nTremblay, Réjean, Ken Dryden, and José Theodore. 2018. “The impact of power outages on goal-keeping in the NHL”, Journal of National Hockey Leagues, vol 32, iss. 1.\n\n\nTremblay, Réjean, Ken Dryden, and José Theodore. 2019. “Power outages during NHL games (updated)”, Canadian Hockey Dataverse, doi:10.1234/nhl.lnh.haha\n\n\n\n\nWhy data citations\nThe Data Citation Principles note that (emphasis added):\n\nSound, reproducible scholarship rests upon a foundation of robust, accessible data. For this to be so in practice as well as theory, data must be accorded due importance in the practice of scholarship and in the enduring scholarly record. In other words, data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research. Data citation, like the citation of other evidence and sources, is good research practice and is part of the scholarly ecosystem supporting data reuse.\n\n\nData citation increases the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and re-usability of research data (known as FAIR).\nThrough data citations, data providers can link to articles (sometimes automatically), allowing them to show the academic value of the data and continue providing the services around data creation.\nData citations open a new path to finding relevant science, by reaching the linked articles through data search interfaces, like openICPSR, Data-Pass, and Google Dataset Search.\n\n\n\nGeneric Guidance\nThe AEA follows the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS), with several additions on the AEA website. As the CMOS states, one of the criteria for a useful citation is conveying authority and permanence:\n\nElectronic content presented without formal ties to a publisher or sponsoring body has the authority equivalent to that of unpublished or self-published material in other media.\n\nThey also note that\n\nAuthors should note that anything posted on the internet is “published” in the sense of copyright and must be treated as such for the purposes of complete citation and clearance of permissions, if relevant.\n\nSeveral standard citations options may be relevant for data citations:\n\nWebsites\nWhen citing information from websites, including data downloaded from websites, use the general website citation style for data:\n\nGoogle. 2017. “Privacy Policy.” Privacy & Terms. Last modified April 17, 2017. https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\n\nYale University. n.d. “About Yale: Yale Facts.” Accessed May 1, 2017. https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/yale-facts.\n\nNote that this does NOT apply when the data have a permanent URL, a DOI, or a suggested citation!\n\nNote that the AEA suggests using footnotes for some types of websites (Newspapers, Online Encyclopedias, and Reference Works). You should use the full citation with entry in the list of references for data downloaded from websites.\n\n\n\nGithub\nMany researchers now use Github to store code or documents. How should Github repositories (or for that matter, Gitlab or Bitbucket) repositories be cited?\nAny online repository can be deleted by its owner at any time, and in that sense, are no more or less robust than websites, and the same rules apply:\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). “A template README for social science replication packages.” Github. https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/. Accessed 2021-07-01.\n\nHowever, online repositories do provide the ability to make releases, providing a better way to pin changes made over time. While this does not change the fundamental treatment as a website, it is a more robust reference:\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). “A template README for social science replication packages.” Github. Release v1.0.0). https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/releases/tag/v1.0.0. Accessed 2021-07-01.\n\nHowever, Github is currently unique among online repositories in enabling an automatic integration with Zenodo for the purpose of “making code citable” (and preserving versions). This changes the citation, because Zenodo-preserved versions are no longer subject to arbitrary deletion. Once a Github website has been preserved on Zenodo, it can be cited as any document or archive with a DOI:\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). A template README for social science replication packages (Version v1.0.0). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4319999\n\nOf note: while Github is unique in its automatic integration, any release of an online code repository can be manually preserved on Zenodo, then cited in the above fashion.\n\n\nOnline databases\nCMOS has a recommendation for online databases:\n\nNASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (object name IRAS F00400+4059; accessed April 6, 2016). http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/.\n\nwhich would be cited in the text as NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.\n\n\nData distributed as supplementary data\nThe CMOS provides examples of how to cite supplementary materials that are attached to a specific article:\n\nSuárez-Rodríguez, M. and C. Macías Garcia. 2014. “There Is No Such a Thing as a Free Cigarette: Lining Nests with Discarded Butts Brings Short-Term Benefits, but Causes Toxic Damage.” Journal of Evolutionary Biology 27, no. 12 (December 2014): 2719–26, https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12531, data deposited at Dryad Digital Repository, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4t5rt.\n\nThe AEA guidance used to provide an example, in which the citation links to the article landing page:\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks: Dataset.” American Economic Review. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763.\n\nNote however that modern data citation guidance suggest that both the article and the data used by the article should be cited, and this can lead to confusion. With the 2019 move of the AEA to a data archive, the correct citation for the above supplement would be:\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “Replication data for: The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks.” American Economic Association [publisher], * Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research distributor*, https://doi.org/10.3886/E112357V1\n\nwith the article also cited as:\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks” American Economic Review. no. 3 (June 2010): 763–801. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763.\n\n\n\nCiting the paper or the data?\nSeveral data distributors already request or require citation as per their terms of use, or as a note on their websites. Often, following traditional usage, they request citation of a published article, not of the data. For example, the widely used “Penn World Tables” request that the article that introduced this version of the Penn tables be cited:\n\nFeenstra, Robert C, Robert Inklaar, and Marcel P Timmer. 2015.”The next generation of the Penn World Table.” American Economic Review, 105(10): 3150-82.\n\nHowever, they also provide a DOI that redirects to the data download page, with various versions of the tables receiving different DOIs. In particular, various of these versions were created after the original article (and database) were published, and are not published in the AER.\nThus, for accurate citations as well as compliance with data citation principles, in addition to citing the Feenstra et al (2015) article as requested by the data provider, authors should also correctly cite the data:\n\nRobert C. Feenstra, Robert Inklaar and Marcel P. Timmer. 2016. “Penn World Table 9.0.” Groningen Growth and Development Centre. https://doi.org/10.15141/S5J01T.\n\n\n\n\nSpecific Guidance\nThe key to data citations is that the creator, the name, the location, and the date last accessed for a data source should be clear. This pertains to online data, offline data, physical data, whether it is in boxes or on tapes, or in a corporate database behind a firewall.\nICPSR notes that a citation should include the following items:\n\nAuthor\nTitle\nDistributor\nDate\nVersion\nPersistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)\n\nNote that all but the URN would apply also for an offline database. Consider the citation of objects in archives:\n\nProducer\nOften, the creator of a dataset is an organization. The same way that an organization as a work’s author can be cited:\n\nISO (International Organization for Standardization). 1997. Information and Documentation—Rules for the Abbreviation of Title Words and Titles of Publications. ISO 4:1997. Paris: ISO.\n\nan organization can be cited as the creator of a dataset:\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\n\nDistributor\nIn many cases, the data are not distributed by the creator. This means the distributor takes on the role of a publisher (of a book, of data). So if using Compustat through the Wharton Research Data Services, one might cite as\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. Wharton Research Data Services. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/\n\nIf using the S&P 500 data, there may be multiple providers:\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P 500 [SP500], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ SP500, January 24, 2020.\n\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P 500, provided via Haver Analytics Data Subscription, February 24, 2018.\n\nwith hopefully the same content. Note that often, such data is subject to copyright and redistribution restrictions (see the page at FRED on SP500).\n\n\nDates\nIn some cases, it isn’t clear when the dataset was published, though it may be clear what time period the dataset covers. One way to address this may be by using the “n.d.” abbreviation for the date of publication:\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). n.d. Compustat-Capital IQ (1982-2017). Wharton Research Data Services. Accessed April 6, 2018. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/\n\n\n\nMany related datasets\nA related issue may arise when the dataset is comprised of multiple years, each of which has its own DOI. For instance, when accessing multiple years of American Community Survey data on ICPSR, each of which has its own DOI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2002\n(ICPSR 3893)\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1998\n(ICPSR 3888)\n2008-05-21\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1997\n(ICPSR 3886)\n2008-05-21\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2003\n(ICPSR 4117)\n2009-12-01\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2004\n(ICPSR 4370)\n2008-10-14\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2009\n(ICPSR 33802)\n2013-04-04\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2008\n(ICPSR 29263)\n2011-11-08\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1996\n(ICPSR 3885)\n2008-05-21\n\n\n\nOne approach to this is to create a composite citation, with additional information available in an online data appendix or a Data Availability Statement:\n\nBureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor DOIs listed in data appendix.\n\nor\n\nBureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/search/studies?q=american+community+survey (accessed November 21, 2019)\n\n(and listing of exact DOIs in an appendix table).\n\n\nOffline access mechanism\nMany datasets are available only under license, memorandum, contract, etc., and do not have a formal online presence. This is quite similar to traditional offline archives, for instance manuscript collections. For such collections, CMOS suggests:\n\nKallen, Horace. Papers. YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York.\n\n\nMerriam, Charles E. Papers. Special Collections Research Center, box 26, folder 17. University of Chicago Library.\n\nand usage in the text as\n\nAlvin Johnson, in a memorandum prepared sometime in 1937 (Kallen Papers, file 36), observed that …\n\nSimilar citations can be constructed for offline databases:\n\nBloom, Nick. 2019. Confidential survey data on Cameroon business processes. Stanford Secure Access Center (file “cameroon-bloom.zip”). Stanford University.\n\n\n\nConfidential databases\nSimilar forms may be used for confidential databases when no DOI exists:\n\nInternal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Department of Treasury, Washington DC, accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nwhere the data, in this case, were accessed via the “Department of Treasury,” acting as a secure distributor (of access, not downloads). If the same data had been accessed via a secure research data center, the reference should have instead noted that access mechanism:\n\nInternal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Federal Research Data Centers distributor, last accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n\nNational Tax Administration. 2015. “Társasági Adóalanyok Mérleg - és Eredménykimutatásai [Dataset].” Magyar Nemzeti Bank distributor. Last accessed at YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nIf multiple databases within the same secure confines are used and combined, they should be cited (within reason) separately. Guidance here may be: Can and do researchers combine various extracts in different ways? For instance, do some combine the IRS 1040 database with death records, and others merge elements from the IRS 1040 database with information returns? Then the information returns, and the 1040 file should be cited separately.\n\nGovernment registers\nIn some cases, governments have list of their (named) registers. For instance, Statistics Denmark provides the full list of registers at https://www.dst.dk/extranet/forskningvariabellister/Oversigt%20over%20registre.html. These can be used to craft data citations, for instance\n\nStatistics Denmark. 2020. “Døde i Danmark (DOD, Deaths in Denmark), 1970-2019 [database]”, Danmarks Statistiks Forskningsservice, accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nwhere the “author” is Statistics Denmark, but the “[publisher]” is the research service of Statistics Denmark. You should note the version (for instance, the current register goes through 2019, but you may have had access to an earlier version, so you should adjust accordingly). In the manuscript, you would then cite “Statistics Denmark (2020)”. If available, the README can point to the codebook for each register, e.g., https://www.dst.dk/extranet/ForskningVariabellister/DOD%20-%20D%C3%B8de%20i%20Danmark.html for the aforementioned “DOD” register. An example can be found in Fadlon and Nielsen (2021).\n\n\nConfidential data with DOI\nIf a DOI exists, the formal citation generated from that DOI should be used:\n\nForschungsdatenzentrum der Bundesagentur für Arbeit. 2020. “Betriebs-Historik-Panel (BHP) – Version 7518 v1.” Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB). https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.BHP7518.DE.EN.V1.\n\n\n\n\nNo formal access mechanism\nIn some cases (not infrequently), access to data is through informal means. The CMOS allows for citation of such information, without inclusion in the references.\n\n(A. P. Møller, unpublished data; C. R. Brown and M. B. Brown, unpublished data)\n\nWe would deviate from that suggestion, ask for inclusion in the reference list, and simply suggest using unpublished data as the locator, similar to a URN, in the reference list:\n\nMøller, A. P. n.d. “Data on Crocodile Sightings in Manhattan.” Unpublished data. Accessed February 29, 2019.\n\n\n\nData provider cannot be named\nIn some cases, the data provider (often a firm) must remain anonymous. This does not prevent citation, and the provider should be mentioned in much the same way as when there is no formal access mechanism:\n\nAnonymous Firm. 1999. “Personnel records of windowshield installers.” Unpublished data. Accessed February 29, 2000.\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors or Producer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of publication:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistent identifier or URL:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of access:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessed or downloaded?\n\n\n Accessed  Downloaded",

Real-life data structures are often more complex, and the distinctions made in the simplified example should be adapted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD;\n    subgraph Dataflow;\n    A((Input data)) ==&gt;  B[Cleaning programs];\n    B ==&gt; C((Analysis data));\n    C ==&gt; D[Analysis programs] \n    D ==&gt; E((Outputs));\n    end;\n    B -.-&gt; F((\"Auxiliary data&lt;br/&gt;(created)\"));\n    F -.-&gt; C;\n    Z((Source)) -.-&gt; X[Data citation] -.-&gt; A;\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Rules and Guidelines\n\nRequirements\nGenerically, journal’s data and code availability policies require that\n\nyou make analysis programs available\nyou provide a README that describes the data acquisition and how to run the analysis process\nyou make every effort to provide as much data as possible in an openly accessible fashion\nyou make every effort to support reproducibility of your analysis\nyou make every effort to transparently describe the creation of your analysis data\nyou cite the data\n\nyou should cite the data in your main manuscript\nyou should cite data separately in your online appendix\n\n\nSome journals may require additional elements:\n\na README in a specific format.\nprograms that create the analysis data (“cleaning programs”)\n\n\n\nSuggestions\nWe strongly suggest using some best-practices as suggested by the literature cited earlier:\n\nseparation of code and data in directory structure and archive locations\nseparation of read-only input data and modified “analysis data”\na clearly defined sequence of processing (possibly through a master controller script)\ncitation of released code\ncitation of data in the README (in addition to citing it in the article itself)\n\nThis website provides some practical guidance.\n\nWe strongly suggest using the template README available on this site.\n\n\n\nEncourage\nWe encourage you\n\nto deposit data early in the research process, as soon as data is collected/ cleaned/ etc. This does not mean that the data becomes public at that time, only that the data has been “locked” in a specific state. See Data and Code Hosting for some options.\nto create a data publication, going into more depth about the data creation (if you created or collected your data)\nto consider splitting out independent components of your data creation (for instance, the auxiliary data described above) as a separately (useful) data deposit\n\n\n\n\nData\nRegarding the data, enough information should be provided\n\nto accurately describe the data so that somebody who doesn’t have knowledge of the data can understand its principal (and salient) characteristics (INFORMATION);\nto be able to acquire the data (whether by download, by contract, by application process, etc.) (ACCESSIBILITY);\nto assure the reader (and the Data Editor) that the data is available for a sufficiently long period of time (PERSISTENCE).\n\n\nFor more details, see Requested information for data.\n\n\n\nPrograms and Code\nWe strongly suggest\n\na clear documentation of all code (within the code/script files themselves, and through a README)\n\nit should be clear from the code (and/or the README) where to find the information contained in each table, figure, and in-text number.\n\nprovision of a master script (“master do file”, “make file”) and a description of how to run or invoke the master script in the README\nidentification of all pre-requisites (data, code, programs, software, possibly operating system)\n(optionally, but useful) a record of how long the code sequence is expected to run - it will help potential replicators to know how to long to expect the programs to run\n\n\nFor details, see our discussion on Requested information for code.\n\n\n\nCiting Data and Code\nAll data should be cited, as per journal guidelines.\n\nFor a discussion with some suggestions, see our Data citation guidance.\n\n\n\nData and Code Availability Statements\nSome of the information historically captured by “README” files is more formally captured by newer “Data (and Code) Availability Statements”. They expand on and complement data citations. Sample language should be incorporated into a README, a distinct document, or a distinct section of the manuscript.\n\nSome examples are listed here.\n\n\n\nData and Code Hosting\nJournals have made supplementary materials available on their websites since the early 2000s. As the popular and scientific web-accessible global infrastructure has matured, other possibilities have opened up. We comment on important features to consider when depositing code and data.\n\nPrinciples\nA code and data repository (or “archive”) should satisfy a few criteria: - be trustworthy - be accessible to others - be persistent, for instance through a continuity plan, but also to disallow deletion of objects - guarantee some level of data integrity - have version control\nNot every web-based location is a code or data repository; on the other hand, numerous non-web based archives are legitimate locations for data to be found (e.g., National Archives).\nFor further details, see our discussion on Requested information on hosting code and data.\n\n\n\nLicensing questions\nIssues about licensing are complex, and this site touches on this topic in the discussion of licensing. We encourage authors to take licensing considerations seriously.",
