    "text": "On this page, we list a few commonly used lightly or heavily restricted data and their data availability statements or licenses, when these are not otherwise easily available. Often, the only restriction is a requirement to not redistribute, and to cite.\nThis page uses a few examples, and suggested descriptions of data access for these examples. If you have an example to suggest for this page, send an email to dataeditor@aeaweb.org or create a pull request.\n\nIPUMS\nIPUMS data are subject to varying usage restrictions. You can find a comprehensive overview of the distribution restrictions at https://ipums.org/about/terms, please consult with IPUMS directly (at ipums@umn.edu) should you have any doubts.\nIPUMS USA Registration page states &gt; IPUMS USA data are available free of charge. Before using the data, researchers must complete this registration and agree to abide by the usage license specified below. […] &gt; &gt; IPUMS USA Usage License &gt; &gt; By completing this registration, you agree to the following terms of use. &gt; - Redistribution: You will not redistribute the data without permission. &gt; - You may not redistribute any data from IPUMS-USA Full Count data. &gt; - For IPUMS-USA Sample data, you may publish a subset of the data to meet journal requirements for accessing data related to a particular publication. &gt; Contact us for permission for any other redistribution of IPUMS-USA Sample data; we will consider requests for free and commercial redistribution. &gt; - Cite the IPUMS USA data appropriately. For information on proper citation refer to citation and use.

All the results in the paper use confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. To gain access to the Census microdata, follow the directions here on how to write a proposal for access to the data via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center: https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/howtoapply.html. 2. You must request the following datasets in your proposal: - Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), 2002 and 2007 - Foreign Trade Database – Import (IMP), 2002 and 2007 - Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), including the Computer Network Use Supplement (CNUS), 1999 - […] - Annual Survey of Magical Inputs (ASMI), 2002 and 2007 3. Reference “Technology and Production Fragmentation: Domestic versus Foreign Sourcing” by Teresa Fort, project number br1179 in the proposal. This will give you access to the programs and input datasets required to reproduce the results. Requesting a search of archives with the articles DOI (“10.1093/restud/rdw057”) should yield the same results.\nNOTE: Project-related files are available for 10 years as of 2015.\n\nSample (unofficial) citations for Census Bureau datasets in the FSRDC can be found on Zotero.org and on Github.\nIn cases where intermediate files (programs or datasets) remain within the secure environment, an authorization (a “license”) might be added to the DCAS. Such an authorization by the author grants others access to and use of such files, subject to any data custodian requirements.\n\nExample of a author granting license for files in secure environment.\n\n\n\nNBER-CES Manufacturing Database\nThe NBER-CES Manufactuing Database does not have an explicit license. It may be in the public domain, since U.S. Government employees co-created it as part of their official duties. Nevertheless, the database should be cited, as well as the working paper associated with it.\nThe files should be cited as “NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (1958-2011)”. You should also cite the earlier working paper as documentation. Please cite these in the manuscript. As per the NBER website,\n\n“We ask that this data not be forwarded on to others. Instead, please refer interested parties to this website.”\n\n\n\nTAXSIM\nTAXSIM is maintained by Daniel Feenberg at the NBER. Those who use its output should probably cite Daniel Feenberg as the author. Note citation request on URL referenced:\n\n\nFeenberg, Daniel Richard, and Elizabeth Coutts, An Introduction to the TAXSIM Model, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management vol 12 no 1, Winter 1993, pages 189-194.\n\n\n\n\nThis paper and this URL (https://www.nber.org/~taxsim) should be cited if any results from TAXSIM are circulated or published.\n\n\n\n\nState or Provincial Data Access\nThe following example is for Massachusetts, but similar data availability statements may be crafted for various other datasets provided by state, provincial, municipal, etc. data providers:\n\nThe data for this project are confidential, but may be obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Researchers interested in access to the data may contact [NAME] at [EMAIL], also see www.doe.mass.edu/research/contact.html. It can take some months to negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication."

    "text": "… although some are not frequently asked, but might nevertheless be useful. Below questions and answers in random order.\n\nDo I need to release my entire code history?\n\nWe work on github already. Is there anyway to make just a “release” public in github without making public the entire code history and issue tickets?\n\nIt all depends if you are comfortable with that, and if this is one paper out of multiple ones stemming from the same project.\nIf not, then what I suggest is to do the following\n\nclean up the repo (possibly in a branch)\non Github, there is no way to fork to your own space, and a fork would carry the entire history anyway. So this assumes manual interaction (I’m going to assume you use the command line for this, this works in git-bash, or bash on Linux/OSX).\ncreate a new clone of your (now cleaned) repo, and switch to the clean branch git clone (WHATEVER)  cd whatever  git branch \"cleaned\"\nnow wipe out all git information: rm -rf .git\ncreate a new repo git init\nAdd all files git add *\n\n(careful with subdirs)\n\nPush to a new Github repo\n\n(on Github, create an empty repo, then push to it)\n(if using the Github Desktop, instead “add existing repo” to the Github Desktop, then push to Github.com)\n\nNow enable this new repo for the Zenodo integration\nCreate a release\n\nThis is now your submission release, cleaned of all history and issues\n\nCite the DOI of your replication archive in your main text.\n\n\n\nMy repo is complex - I only want to share a portion\nScenario: Author keeps several papers related to an ongoing or long-running project in a single repo, and wants to isolate code for tidy submission alongside an “offshoot paper”.\nIn this case, it has been suggested to use the git filter-branch approach, which is essentially a way to split off a subset of a repo into a new repo (e.g. a subdirectory paper-1). It will conveniently inherit the commit history as well (but see above if that is not desired). See guide at https://help.github.com/en/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository.\n(Thanks to @MichaelChirico for suggesting)\n\n\nData Citation without Online Link\n\nDo you have any examples of data citation for proprietary data that does not have an online link? All the examples are much more formal than the random spreadsheets [agency 1] sent over! [agency 2] has a more formal naming system, but again, there’s no persistent indicator for the datasets because they are not accessible.\n\nA known problem with no clear solution. Here’s how I try to approach the problem:\n\nA citation has author, title, and a publisher, with optional other locators. (see Chicago Manual of Style (subscription) and CMS Quick Guide on citations.\n\nNote that Chicago-style does not actually require the locator information - see the examples for “E-book” Kindle.\n\n“Electronic content presented without formal ties to a publisher or sponsoring body has the authority equivalent to that of unpublished or self-published material in other media.”\n\nThus, one can construct the citation as - Author: the provider of the data (the agency) - Title: whatever the provider would recognize and re-furnish to a third-party - Publisher: the provider of the data (or its higher-level institution, e.g., the government department or ministry) - Locators (optional): maybe something along the lines of “Multiple electronic files” with possible additional information “, provided to the author under DUA (date or any contract number)”\nAn example might thus be:\n\nAgency 1. 2007. Name of DataSet. Boston: Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Multiple electronic files.\n\nFor more information, see the AEA Data Editor’s guidance on Data Citations.\n\n\nThe URL works for me. Why are you complaining that it is not robust/persistent/permanent?\nThis may happen for both data files and documents by non-standard publishers. We explain what this means, and various ways to deal with it.\nA URL is simply a locator for a file on the internet. However, they are not all created equal. In particular, files on sites from anything other than robust institutions (archives, journals, newspapers) should be considered to be transitory: here today, gone tomorrow. This often applies to even big companies that are not in the business of publishing with the goal of long-term preservation. It also includes URLs that obviously point to storage providers: Dropbox.com, Google Drive, AWS, Github.io, etc.\nFor instance, the file https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.upl/nwica.org/unitedstates2014.pdf is hosted on Amazon AWS, a commercial provider, presumably by the website of NWICA (nwica.org). If tomorrow NWICA decides to change suppliers for their webservices, and migrates their website nwica.org to the site of myhoster.com, that URL will change. What is less likely to change is the original “landing page” from which “unitedstates2014.pdf” could be downloaded, though that can also change a few years from now. For preservation, the PDF could be copied onto an institution whose business it is to preserve files, such as Zenodo, or Archive.org, where it becomes “permanently” available (or at least at much longer).\n\nSolutions\n\nThird-best: Cite the original landing page, with an access date, as any other URL on the web:\n\n\nNWICA. 2015. “How WIC Impacts the People of the United States of America.” Accessed at https://nwica.org/documents/unitedstates2014/ on August 2, 2017.\n\nand provide a copy of the file, if copyright and license permit.\n\nSecond-best: Use Archive.org’s Save a Page feature to make a copy of the file, and then cite the stable URL thus generated.\n\n\nNWICA. 2015. “How WIC Impacts the People of the United States of America.” Accessed via Archive.org at https://web.archive.org/web/20200205043504/https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.upl/nwica.org/unitedstates2014.pdf on February 4, 2020.\n\n\nFirst-best: Ask the publisher to provide a stable URL.\n\n\n\n\nData Citation with only a top-level Online Link\nMany databases with an online interface make it hard to find an easy-to-cite URL. Nevertheless, a few clicks can often show a referenceable URL. Here’s an example:\n\nOECD Statistics\nThe top-level URL is https://stats.oecd.org/, and (almost) never changes. However, the User Guide, page 34, shows how to share a URL for a particular query. The usual citation rules for URLs then can be applied.\n\n\n\nSome econometrics papers might be accompanied by (for example) an R or Stata package (perhaps published on CRAN or SSC). What about surfacing references to associated packages more prominently?\nFirst, packages on CRAN and the Statistical Software Components can be cited. AEA citation guidance is currently silent on software components, but it is not wrong to cite them, and other disciplines do it regularly. CRAN in fact has elements of a “proper archive” (SSC does NOT). All R packages can generate a (Bibtex) citation.\nSecond, it is possible to submit such packages to various journals, where they are reviewed and published with DOI: - R Journal - Stata Journal - Journal of Statistical Software\n\n\nI have been told by the Data Editor to remove PSID data from my submitted materials. What do I do?\nPer the PSID website, authors are not allowed to post extracts of their data online. The reason is that any user needs to agree to the PSID terms of use before being given access to the data. However, the PSID has provided authors with the ability to deposit their data extracts and/or their derived data in a repository, precisely for the purpose of allowing for sharing in compliance with their Terms of use.\nIn order to comply with the PSID Terms of use, you should do the following:\n\nCreate a new deposit at the PSID repository. Be sure to choose the PSID repository! (it can be confusing)\n\nGive the deposit the title “Supplementary data for: (TITLE OF YOUR PAPER)”\nUpload only the data files related to PSID\nFill out as much of the additional information as you can, including the Time Period covered.\nGo through the process to “Publish” this data\nYou will obtain a DOI that looks somewhat like https://doi.org/10.3886/E123456V1. Copy that down.\n\nReturn to your AEA deposit\nDelete your PSID files that you just uploaded to the PSID repository\nIn the “Related Publications”, add the DOI you just copied down as a “related” publication\nUpdate your README and any other instructions to identify the DOI for the files that a replicator must download separately in order to reproduce your results.\nDon’t forget to cite the DOI you copied down in your manuscript!\nPer the PSID website, you should include the following acknowledgement:\nThe collection of data used in this study was partly supported by the National Institutes of Health under grant number R01 HD069609 and R01 AG040213, and the National Science Foundation under award numbers SES 1157698 and 1623684.\nPSID also wants you to send copies of the manuscript to them, or add the DOI of your published article to their bibliography. Please do so, supporting them!\n\n\n\nI use confidential data. I am allowed to provide the data to the Data Editor for the purpose of replication, but you are not allowed to publish the data. How do I proceed?\nFirst, all sharing - whether privately with us, or publicly through the data publication process - should be in compliance with all IRB rules, data use agreements, etc. We will never ask you to share data that you do not have the right to share with us or anybody else.\nSecond, there is a difference between sharing with us, and publishing the data. We can accept private data sharing for the purpose of replication, conduct our reproducibility checks, and delete the data provided. You are in control of the publication of any data (though it has happened that we have had to point out to authors that they do not, in fact, have the rights to publish data that they were going to publish).\nThird, the inability to publish the data does not absolve you from creating an archive of the data as it was used for the article. This archive, for private/confidential/proprietary data, should remain private - on your own systems, or appropriate university archives. But it must exist, so that you can reliably answer queries from authors in future years.\nHow should you proceed?\nThe best way to think of this is as a set of layers. Your working directory WD, from which you derived the tables and figures in the paper, is composed of confidential data CD, non-confidential data NCD, and programs/code P (and possibly temporary files TF). So WD = CD + NCD + P + TF. For the purpose of replication archives, you should create two archives:\n\nA.zip : contains NCD and P\nB.zip : contains CD\n\nYou should then test: create an empty directory, unpack the two archives, and verify that they are sufficient:\n\n(unzip A.zip) + (unzip B.zip) == NCD + P + CD == WD - TF\n\nYou should then import A.zip into the openICPSR archive, and ensure that B.zip is properly and securely archived, in compliance with all rules that you are subject to.\nYou can provide B.zip to us for the purpose of replication, but B.zip would not be published.\n\n\nHow can I ensure that the confidential data is preserved?\nThe ideal promise that has the highest credibility is a commitment from the provider of the confidential data to maintain the data for a number of years.\nA second-best solution requires that you inspect your data use agreement. Can you archive the data in a robust fashion (using whatever tools your university has)? Some DUA allow for that, others don’t. The promise then becomes that you/your university will guarantee persistence of the data for X years.\nA better variant of that is when the DUA allows you to share the data with others that have also demonstratably signed a DUA with the provider. The data provider controls the access, you (your archive) provides the data."

    "text": "(This template can be used by the Data Editor to contact data providers)\nDear [name],\nthe American Economic Association has a data and code availability policy that applies to researchers who submit articles for publication to our journals. Inter alia, this policy requests that authors provide accurate and persistent information about how other researchers can find and access data, whether that data be created by the authors or by third parties. Elements of such information are persistent URLs or Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), description of access conditions, and terms of use.\nOne of our authors has used your data, and we are inquiring about any such information you could provide either to us or to authors upon request. We are looking for - DOI for specific datasets or files - URLs or DOI pointing to licenses (or, if the files are license-free, a statement to that effect) - URLs or DOI pointing to terms of use - the conditions under which researchers may use and possibly republish the data (this may be the same as the license) - URLs, DOI, or information regarding how long you will maintain the datasets you make available If you have such information available, we would be grateful if you could point us in the right direction. If you do not yet have such information, any plans you might have would be of interest to us.\nThis is a new initiative at the AEA, and we understand that historically, much of what we are looking for above was not part of standard practice in our research community. We are trying to improve the overall transparency and thus reproducible of economics, and this is part of that effort.\nI would be available to discuss this further with you and your institution.\nSincerely,\nData Editor of the American Economic Association"

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\nDownstream recipients.\nA. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nB. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\nNo endorsement.

In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\nAttribution.\n\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nA. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\na copyright notice;\na notice that refers to this Public License;\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\nB. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\nC. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\nIf You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter’s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

They expand on and complement data citations. Sample language should be incorporated into a README, a distinct document, or a distinct section of the manuscript.\nSome examples are listed here.\n\n\nPrograms and Code\nWe strongly suggest\n\na clear documentation of all code (within the code/script files themselves, and through a README)\n\nit should be clear from the code (and/or the README) where to find the information contained in each table, figure, and in-text number.\n\nprovision of a master script (“master do file”, “make file”) and a description of how to run or invoke the master script in the README\nidentification of all pre-requisites (data, code, programs, software, possibly operating system)\n(optionally, but useful) a record of how long the code sequence is expected to run - it will help potential replicators to know how to long to expect the programs to run\n\nFor details, see our discussion on Requested information for code.\n\n\nData and Code Hosting\nJournals have made supplementary materials available on their websites since the early 2000s. As the popular and scientific web-accessible global infrastructure has matured, other possibilities have opened up. We comment on important features to consider when depositing code and data.\n\nPrinciples\nA code and data repository (or “archive”) should satisfy a few criteria: - be trustworthy - be accessible to others - be persistent, for instance through a continuity plan, but also to disallow deletion of objects - guarantee some level of data integrity - have version control\nNot every web-based location is a code or data repository; on the other hand, numerous non-web based archives are legitimate locations for data to be found (e.g., National Archives).\nFor further details, see our discussion on Requested information on hosting code and data.\n\n\n\nLicensing questions\nIssues about licensing are complex, and this site touches on this topic in the discussion of licensing.

Note however that the human-readable variable name (e.g. “Earnings”) still needs to be mapped to the name in the dataset, if different (e.g., “var31a”)\nIf confidentiality protection is a concern,\n\ntalk to your data provider.\nYou may be able to apply simple count and fraction rounding rules (see code in this Github repository), or remove some summary statistics (e.g., max/min or specific quantiles).\nFor additional guidance, see\n\n\nWhere multiple versions of the data exist, describe the version of the data used by the author.\nThis information can be generated by the paper author, or provided by pointing to a URL of the data provider (for instance an online codebook).\n\n\nPractical guidance: Data description\nIt doesn’t need to be complicated, but should be complete. For more extensive descriptions, best practices, and possible support, see - ICSPR, “Guide to Social Science Data Preparation and Archiving: Phase 3: Data Collection and File Creation” - DataONE Primer on Data Management Best Practices - Yale Institution for Social and Policy Studies - Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research - World Bank DIME Checklist\nOther services may be available at your own institution. Some services may charge a fee, or only be available to researchers affiliated with that institution.\nWe provide a few suggestions for how to do this in Stata, R, and SAS. However, if you have the ability to do a more robust data description, you should. See a self-citing example.\n\n\n\nData access description\nThe description of data access should provide enough information so that an uninformed user could theoretically access the data. Data access descriptions are often referred to as “Data Availability Statements”.\n\nIn the flow diagram above, it is the answer to the question: Who can access “Data Source” at “Data Provider” and create an extract.\n\nThe access should be persistent, i.e., not rely on a transitory website or the presence of a particular person who might change jobs at any time.\n\nThis can be as simple as a download URL.\nIt might be a pointer to a directory in the replication archive.\nThis might also be the URL for a description of the application procedure (dataprovider.com/application_procedure.html). Real examples include\n\nNCHS, https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/leftbrch/userestricdt.htm ,\nPSID https://simba.isr.umich.edu/restricted/ProcessReq.aspx)\n\nThe access description should include an estimate of the monetary and time cost of the application process.\nIf you provided a Data Management Plan (DMP) as part of a grant proposal, much of the information may already be present in the DMP.\nProvide the date when the data access description was valid. For long-running projects, this may be the information when YOU accessed the data, or it may be the access information for somebody who wants to access the data TODAY.\nProvide information on the access conditions:\n\nThis is often defined within a license.\nOpen-access data is often under a Creative Commons - Attribution (CC-BY) license.\nIf any license is posted or stated, link to it.\nTerms of use and license are not exactly the same thing.\nDoes a downloader need to agree to simple terms of use? (Example: IPUMS-USA https://usa.ipums.org/usa/cite.shtml)\nDoes the researcher need to provide information (project proposal, computer security plan, etc.)? (Example: PSID https://simba.isr.umich.edu/U/CondUse.aspx)\nIs there perhaps a residency or citizen requirement?\n\n\n\nPractical guidance: data access\n\nWhile non-academic data providers may not always consider reproducibility when you sign a contract with them, we have found numerous such providers which are open to at least the idea of “reproducibility checking” or replication. Examples of agreements which allow third-parties to access confidential data for the purpose of replication,\n\nsupplementary materials to Barseghyan et al (2013) (in particular the data-user-agreements.pdf).\n\nFor additional guidance on licensing, see Licensing guidance.\nFor more information on Data Access Descriptions, see Data Access Descriptions.\n\nFor additional sample “Data Access Descriptions”, see\n\nthe Template README\nJournal of Applied Econometrics’ Data Archive.\n\n\n\n\nData persistence\nData should remain available for a sufficiently long time.\n\nBy depositing in the journal-based data (and code) repositories, the data (and code) will remain available indefinitely.\nThis is also true if the data is in various other repositories\nThis may also be true if the data cannot be shared (restricted access data).\nAgain, this may already have been defined in your DMP.\nA good minimum benchmark is 10 years, but this may not always be feasible with data the author does not control. You should describe the data persistence, or point to a data archive’s policy in that matter.\n\n\nSee Requested_information_hosting for more details on data repositories.\n\n\n\nWhat is a data provider\nA “data provider” in this sense can be - a public repository where the data can be found (ICPSR), - a website that provided the data (IPUMS), - a statistical agency or private company that granted access to the data (U.S. Census Bureau, Twitter, Acme Inc.).\nThe author may also be the data provider, for instance, because the author conducted the survey used in the article. However, in many cases, the data provider may not be a data archive (see the page on Requested information about hosting).\n\nPractical guidance: data provider and data archives\nIf the data provider is not an archive (i.e., the data persistence is insufficient, and data might go away), you should investigate depositing the data at a data archive.\n\n\n\nPlanning Ahead\nMany of the items above can be planned ahead of time. In fact, funding agencies require data management plans, and these are core elements of data management plans. - ICPSR, “Guidelines for Effective Data Management Plans”\nConsider from the start what is needed to share the data. - ICPSR, “Guide to Social Science Data Preparation and Archiving Phase 5: Preparing Data for Sharing” If planning to use restricted-access data (private, commmercial, confidential data), consider asking the provider about their support of replication exercises.\nIf collecting data, consider early on the need to have just enough restrictions. - ICPSR, “Recommended Informed Consent Language for Data Sharing” - EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Language on consent\nConsider breaking your data archives into manageable pieces. For instance, raw data might be in a different location/repository/archive than the analysis data, even if you are providing access to both for the purpose of replication.

    "text": "Sometimes, it is worthwhile to not convolute a particular useful dataset within a replication package. Pulling it out, depositing it in its own right, is easy, and yields much greater findability through search engines such as ICPSR or Google Dataset Search.\nThe approach is relatively simple.\n\nChoose a repository\nChoose any one of the open trusted repositories (see our document on data and code hosting). You want to maximize findability, but also credit.\nNotes:\n\nFor US government data, datalumos.org is a site that “rescues” data, but it obfuscates a bit the contribution of the author.\n\nFor instance, I deposited this data at datalumos.org: but my contribution is not visible. It might be possible to add your name to the “Collection Notes” or similar. Not ideal.\nGenerically, you can achieve great findability of Census Bureau data by using one of the ICPSR properties, in this case probably openICPSR (similar to, but distinct from your AEA deposit).\n\nSome examples are given in our document on data and code hosting.\nIf you are at an ICPSR member institution, or have a forthcoming paper in the AEA journals, you may submit to ICPSR, including leveraging the expertise of their professional data curation team.\n\n\n\nDeposit the data and fill out metadata\n\nFill out the title and other things.\n\nChoose a title that emulates the title for the official (digital-first). For instance, if you were to deposit historical files for the U.S. Economic Census, you would emulate Census Bureau publications, either per year (1987 Economic Census) or collected (Historical Economic Census).\n\nBe sure to add yourself as the “Principal Investigator”\nFill out as much as you can about the metadata.\nFor “Collection Notes”, describe accurately where the files come from, and what you did to them to make them usable.\nIf you still have them, also upload the original formats, in addition to any converted files.\n\n\n\nGoing an additional extra mile\n\nIf you wish, check with one of the data librarians at your institution to dot the is and cross the ts.\n\n\n\nAdd related publication\nIf the chosen repository allows to do this, add your own publication (which uses and/or documents the data) as a related publication.\n\n\nHit publish.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Journals offer guidance on citation, you may want to check there first. The guidance provided here is in addition, and may be the basis for future official guidance.\n\nData Citations\nProperly referencing data goes beyond just reproducibility - it is also proper scientific writing style. In the same way that authors use bibliographic references to “printed” resources, they should also be using such references for data resources, to give and receive credit where credit is due. Not referencing an article or book is at best an oversight, and at worst plagiarism - and the same should apply to data objects. Numerous guides and tutorials exist, some of which provide a variety of examples.\n\nDataONE Tutorial on Data Citation and generic guidance\nICPSR\nForce11’s Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principals\nthe AEA’s Sample References\nMichigan State University\nUC Santa Cruz\nOSF\n\n\n\nWhat to cite\nIn a nutshell, every dataset is to be cited. This is true for the main article as well as online appendices. In the past, use of data or code has been acknowledged in footnotes, and only rarely through bibliographic references. However, if the dataset is used, it should appear in the bibliography. The same is true for code reused from previous papers, or provided by authors.\n\nData is published\nThe DOI is thus public, and all repositories will provide a suggested citation. One can also use https://www.doi2bib.org/ or https://citation.crosscite.org/ to get a citation (see below for additional tools).\n\n\nData is not published\nThis is trickier. The data does not necessarily have a title that is related to the paper. Some repositories allow authors to “reserve” a DOI (Zenodo) or to delay publication. For some repositories, the DOI, while not officially reserved, can be derived from information already available (see this FAQ for openICPSR, something similar may be possible at Dataverse).\nIn some cases, authors may be able to delay publication, and coordinate it with the publication of the article (openICPSR, possibly Zenodo).\n\n\n\nWhere to cite\nIn all cases, data and code should be cited in the main manuscript. They should also be referenced in the data availability statement (some journals) or the README (other journals).\n\n\nHow to cite\nMany journals in economics require the Chicago style for citations and bibliographies 1. However, the Chicago Style Manual provides few relevant examples for data citations. Applications like Zotero and Mendeley Desktop also do not support data citations robustly, even though the underlying Citation Style Language has had the concept of a “data” entry for several years.\nDataONE suggests content and style that resemble the generic working paper or article citation style (adapted to Chicago style):\n\nWestbrook JW, Kitajima K, Burleigh JG, Kress WJ, Erickson DL, Wright SJ (2011) Data from: What makes a leaf tough? Patterns of correlated evolution between leaf toughness traits and demographic rates among 197 shade-tolerant woody species in a neotropical forest. Dryad Digital Repository. http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8525\n\nICPSR notes that a citation should include the following items: - Title - Author - Date - Version - Persistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)\nand provides a few examples, with some additional modifiers:\n\nEsther Duflo; Rohini Pande, 2006, ``Dams, Poverty, Public Goods and Malaria Incidence in India’’, http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/IOJHHXOOLZ UNF:5:obNHHq1gtV400a4T+Xrp9g== Murray Research Archive [Distributor] V2 [Version]\n\nFinally, the AEA style guide suggests\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968.’’ Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI. ICPSR05404-v1. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404 (accessed February 8, 2011).\n\nThis may be adjusted. An alternate citation may be\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968.’’ Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI. ICPSR05404-v1. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05404.\n\nCitations to primary data can sometimes be hard to construct. If the data provider has a suggested citation, then you should use it. Alternatively, you can construct as per the above examples, for instance, as noted on the AEA style guide:\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” United States Department of Labor. http://data.bls.gov/cgi- bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011).\n\n\n\nSome additional guidance on tricky citations\n\nAdditional guidance on Data Citations.\nData citation without an online link\nSample (unofficial) citations for Census Bureau datasets in the FSRDC can be found on Zotero.org and on Github.\n\n\n\nSome Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen providing data citations, please be sure to check that a URL is given. However, there are some subtleties:\n\nIf only a single file is downloaded from a website, the data citation should include the precise URL (https://data.com/path/to/file), not just a top-level URL (https://data.com)\nIf a URL is giving starting with “https://doi.org”, then it is a DOI. Those do not need access dates. Otherwise, a website access needs a URL (by most citation styles).\nBe sure to provide the DOI when both a DOI and a URL is available. A DOI is stable, a URL may not be.\nAlways check the URL by clicking on it, Sometimes, the URL turns out to be generic/top-level, and does not show the file the replicator should be downloading. The replicator should be able to find the file using the URL, or with the instructions in the README.\n\nCheck for a license/data use agreement.\n\nJust because data is visible does not mean it can be redistributed. By default, it is not (copyright).\nRegardless of redistribution rights, the URL of the data use agreement should be included in the README/online appendix to fully describe data access conditions.\nIdeally, a copy of the data use agreement or license should be included in the replication archive. This can be a copy of an email authorizing you to distribute the data, or a copy of the data use agreement on the website when you downloaded the data (which might be different from the current data use agreement!)\n\nSome data use agreements may also require specific citations (of papers, of code). Verify that you are compliant with all such requirements!\n\nThe same actually applies for Stata or R packages that may be downloaded.\nIt is R practice to cite all packages, and R makes that easy. This should be noted in the report, if not done. Citation in the README should be sufficient.\nIn Stata, some packages have citation requirements. Check the website of the author, sometimes also the *.ado file the author downloads. For instance, many authors use “reghdfe”. See https://github.com/sergiocorreia/reghdfe#citation for a citation requirement.\n\n\n\n\nTools\nNo tool is perfect, but you will likely find the one that works for your particular workflow. Some examples for specific software: - BibTeX - BibLaTeX - Zotero will have native dataset functionality starting in version 5.1, for now, some guidance for entering it can be found in forums. Note that support in the citation styles is also still lacking. - Mendeley Desktop.\n\nTools when the object has a DOI\nThere are several websites that will create a (data) citation from any DOI. Give these a try:\nDOI Citation Formatter at citation.crosscite.org/ is supported by the DOI Registration Agencies. For instance, using 10.3886/ICPSR05404 from the above example, it generates (as of 2022-01-16):\n\nChicago Author-date (16th edition)\n\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1984. “Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945-1968.” ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404.\n\n\nAPA style:\n\n\nLeiss, A. (1984). Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945-1968 [Data set]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05404\n\ndoi2bib at doi2bib.org/ will generate a BibTeX entry from a DOI (for instance from 10.3886/ICPSR05404):\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.3886/icpsr05404,\n  doi = {10.3886/ICPSR05404},\n  url = {http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/5404},\n  author = {Leiss,  Amelia},\n  language = {en},\n  title = {Arms Transfers to Developing Countries,  1945-1968},\n  publisher = {ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research},\n  year = {1984}\n}\n\n\nWhen the object does not have a DOI\nWhen the object does not have a DOI, it isn’t really that much more complicated, but little guidance is available.\n\nCitation Machine - choose Source type=Digital file and put the URL and access date into the Annotation field.\nTry our own tool:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors or Producer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of publication:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistent identifier or URL:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of access:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessed or downloaded?\n\n\n Accessed  Downloaded",

    "section": "GIS data files",
    "text": "GIS data files\nOne of the most commonly used geospatial data formats is a set of files collectively referred to as a “shapefile”. These are often distributed as ZIP archives, but for any given project, are generally within a separate directory. There are at least three mandatory files, ending in shp, shx, and dbf. The shp file contains the vector geometries (points, lines, polygons) that appear on a map (“features”). The dbf is an attribute table (in dBase IV format), and can be created and manipulated by other programs as well, including Stata, R, and Python. The shx file is an index that links the geometries to the corresponding attribute data. There are several other optional sidecar files that should be retained, if present. For example, a .prj file defines the projection, or coordinate system of the geometries. Shapefiles have notable technical limitations (such as 10-character attribute names, 254-character text field values, 255 attribute limit, and 2GB file size) but the format is well-understood and widely implemented.\nGeospatial data also comes in many other formats. GeoPackage is a modern GIS data standard that overcomes many of the shapefile limitations, and is now widely supported. Like the shapefile, it supports vector data, but GeoPackage can also contain raster (pixel-based) data. The most widely-used raster data format is GeoTIFF, but large, multi-dimensional datasets are often shared in NetCDF format.\nNon-geospatial tabular data is often combined with geospatial data for analysis. CSV is recommended as a well-known format. Geospatial point data may also be shared in CSV format, with the inclusion of two fields for the X and Y coordinates. Longitude and latitude is often used for global datasets, but there are hundreds of local coordinate systems in common use, so be sure to document the coordinate system being used.",

For instance, some shapefiles in the US will be sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, which uses them for various statistical activities. These sources should be clearly outlined.\nAny processing to combine data in preparation of creating a map, as well as the processing steps to create the map, need to be described in a reproducible workflow.",

These models can effectively turn a complex flow into something that looks like just another processing tool, so that the same model can be run on another input, or with different starting parameters. There may be some variations in the format between ArcGIS software versions that should be investigated when considering their use for reproducibility. Models can also be exported to a Python script, which might be better from a reproducibility perspective, although they will still depend on access to licensed ArcGIS python libraries in order to run. It is also possible to write ArcPy scripts by hand.\nEsri’s newer ArcGIS Pro (as opposed to the older ArcMap) has “ArcGIS Notebooks” which are based on Jupyter.\nHowever, it seems many Esri users are still using the older ArcMap.\n\nResources\nEsri Academy has many ArcGIS tutorials and web courses.

    "text": "One of the most vexing issues is how to cite data. This document goes through a few common scenarios not covered elsewhere.\n\nWhat is not a data citation\nMany authors initially neglect to add data citations, or do not know how to add a data citation. Often, we see authors cite papers with supplementary data, but not databases or other data:\n\n\nWe use data acquired from the NHL, dates of power outages collected by Tremblay et al (2018), augmented with information on the language and grammar skills of hockey players provided by the Ethnologue database.\n\n\n(note absence of citation for NHL and Ethnologue data). In the above example, three datasets are used, but only one is cited in some fashion.\n\nBetter\nThe above example can be improved as follows:\n\n\nWe use data acquired from the NHL (NHL, 2018), dates of power outages collected by Tremblay et al (2018, 2019), augmented with information on the language and grammar skills of hockey players provided by the Ethnologue database (Eberhard et al, 2019).\n\n\nwith the reference list having the following entries:\n\nEberhard, David M., Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2019. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. Twenty-second edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com.\n\n\nNational Hockey League. 2018. NHL Game Database 1917-2018. National Hockey League Hall of Fame, Toronto, ON.

For this to be so in practice as well as theory, data must be accorded due importance in the practice of scholarship and in the enduring scholarly record. In other words, data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research. Data citation, like the citation of other evidence and sources, is good research practice and is part of the scholarly ecosystem supporting data reuse.\n\n\nData citation increases the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and re-usability of research data (known as FAIR).\nThrough data citations, data providers can link to articles (sometimes automatically), allowing them to show the academic value of the data and continue providing the services around data creation.\nData citations open a new path to finding relevant science, by reaching the linked articles through data search interfaces, like openICPSR, Data-Pass, and Google Dataset Search.\n\n\n\nGeneric Guidance\nThe AEA follows the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS), with several additions on the AEA website. As the CMOS states, one of the criteria for a useful citation is conveying authority and permanence:\n\nElectronic content presented without formal ties to a publisher or sponsoring body has the authority equivalent to that of unpublished or self-published material in other media.\n\nThey also note that\n\nAuthors should note that anything posted on the internet is “published” in the sense of copyright and must be treated as such for the purposes of complete citation and clearance of permissions, if relevant.\n\nSeveral standard citations options may be relevant for data citations:\n\nWebsites\nWhen citing information from websites, including data downloaded from websites, use the general website citation style for data:\n\nGoogle. 2017. “Privacy Policy.” Privacy & Terms. Last modified April 17, 2017. https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\n\nYale University. n.d. “About Yale: Yale Facts.” Accessed May 1, 2017. https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/yale-facts.\n\nNote that this does NOT apply when the data have a permanent URL, a DOI, or a suggested citation!\n\nNote that the AEA suggests using footnotes for some types of websites (Newspapers, Online Encyclopedias, and Reference Works). You should use the full citation with entry in the list of references for data downloaded from websites.\n\n\n\nGithub\nMany researchers now use Github to store code or documents. How should Github repositories (or for that matter, Gitlab or Bitbucket) repositories be cited?\nAny online repository can be deleted by its owner at any time, and in that sense, are no more or less robust than websites, and the same rules apply:\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). “A template README for social science replication packages.” Github. https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/. Accessed 2021-07-01.\n\nHowever, online repositories do provide the ability to make releases, providing a better way to pin changes made over time. While this does not change the fundamental treatment as a website, it is a more robust reference:\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). “A template README for social science replication packages.” Github. Release v1.0.0). https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/releases/tag/v1.0.0. Accessed 2021-07-01.\n\nHowever, Github is currently unique among online repositories in enabling an automatic integration with Zenodo for the purpose of “making code citable” (and preserving versions). This changes the citation, because Zenodo-preserved versions are no longer subject to arbitrary deletion. Once a Github website has been preserved on Zenodo, it can be cited as any document or archive with a DOI:\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). A template README for social science replication packages (Version v1.0.0). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4319999\n\nOf note: while Github is unique in its automatic integration, any release of an online code repository can be manually preserved on Zenodo, then cited in the above fashion.\n\n\nOnline databases\nCMOS has a recommendation for online databases:\n\nNASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (object name IRAS F00400+4059; accessed April 6, 2016). http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/.\n\nwhich would be cited in the text as NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.\n\n\nData distributed as supplementary data\nThe CMOS provides examples of how to cite supplementary materials that are attached to a specific article:\n\nSuárez-Rodríguez, M. and C. Macías Garcia. 2014. “There Is No Such a Thing as a Free Cigarette: Lining Nests with Discarded Butts Brings Short-Term Benefits, but Causes Toxic Damage.” Journal of Evolutionary Biology 27, no. 12 (December 2014): 2719–26, https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12531, data deposited at Dryad Digital Repository, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4t5rt.\n\nThe AEA guidance used to provide an example, in which the citation links to the article landing page:\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks: Dataset.” American Economic Review. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763.\n\nNote however that modern data citation guidance suggest that both the article and the data used by the article should be cited, and this can lead to confusion. With the 2019 move of the AEA to a data archive, the correct citation for the above supplement would be:\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “Replication data for: The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks.” American Economic Association [publisher], * Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research distributor*, https://doi.org/10.3886/E112357V1\n\nwith the article also cited as:\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks” American Economic Review. no. 3 (June 2010): 763–801. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763.\n\n\n\nCiting the paper or the data?\nSeveral data distributors already request or require citation as per their terms of use, or as a note on their websites. Often, following traditional usage, they request citation of a published article, not of the data. For example, the widely used “Penn World Tables” request that the article that introduced this version of the Penn tables be cited:\n\nFeenstra, Robert C, Robert Inklaar, and Marcel P Timmer. 2015.”The next generation of the Penn World Table.” American Economic Review, 105(10): 3150-82.\n\nHowever, they also provide a DOI that redirects to the data download page, with various versions of the tables receiving different DOIs. In particular, various of these versions were created after the original article (and database) were published, and are not published in the AER.\nThus, for accurate citations as well as compliance with data citation principles, in addition to citing the Feenstra et al (2015) article as requested by the data provider, authors should also correctly cite the data:\n\nRobert C. Feenstra, Robert Inklaar and Marcel P. Timmer. 2016. “Penn World Table 9.0.” Groningen Growth and Development Centre. https://doi.org/10.15141/S5J01T.\n\n\n\n\nSpecific Guidance\nThe key to data citations is that the creator, the name, the location, and the date last accessed for a data source should be clear. This pertains to online data, offline data, physical data, whether it is in boxes or on tapes, or in a corporate database behind a firewall.\nICPSR notes that a citation should include the following items:\n\nAuthor\nTitle\nDistributor\nDate\nVersion\nPersistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)\n\nNote that all but the URN would apply also for an offline database. Consider the citation of objects in archives:\n\nProducer\nOften, the creator of a dataset is an organization. The same way that an organization as a work’s author can be cited:\n\nISO (International Organization for Standardization). 1997. Information and Documentation—Rules for the Abbreviation of Title Words and Titles of Publications. ISO 4:1997. Paris: ISO.\n\nan organization can be cited as the creator of a dataset:\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\n\nDistributor\nIn many cases, the data are not distributed by the creator. This means the distributor takes on the role of a publisher (of a book, of data). So if using Compustat through the Wharton Research Data Services, one might cite as\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. Wharton Research Data Services. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/\n\nIf using the S&P 500 data, there may be multiple providers:\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P 500 [SP500], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ SP500, January 24, 2020.\n\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P 500, provided via Haver Analytics Data Subscription, February 24, 2018.\n\nwith hopefully the same content. Note that often, such data is subject to copyright and redistribution restrictions (see the page at FRED on SP500).\n\n\nDates\nIn some cases, it isn’t clear when the dataset was published, though it may be clear what time period the dataset covers. One way to address this may be by using the “n.d.” abbreviation for the date of publication:\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). n.d. Compustat-Capital IQ (1982-2017). Wharton Research Data Services. Accessed April 6, 2018. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/\n\n\n\nMany related datasets\nA related issue may arise when the dataset is comprised of multiple years, each of which has its own DOI. For instance, when accessing multiple years of American Community Survey data on ICPSR, each of which has its own DOI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2002\n(ICPSR 3893)\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1998\n(ICPSR 3888)\n2008-05-21\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1997\n(ICPSR 3886)\n2008-05-21\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2003\n(ICPSR 4117)\n2009-12-01\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2004\n(ICPSR 4370)\n2008-10-14\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2009\n(ICPSR 33802)\n2013-04-04\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2008\n(ICPSR 29263)\n2011-11-08\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1996\n(ICPSR 3885)\n2008-05-21\n\n\n\nOne approach to this is to create a composite citation, with additional information available in an online data appendix or a Data Availability Statement:\n\nBureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor DOIs listed in data appendix.\n\nor\n\nBureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/search/studies?q=american+community+survey (accessed November 21, 2019)\n\n(and listing of exact DOIs in an appendix table).\n\n\nOffline access mechanism\nMany datasets are available only under license, memorandum, contract, etc., and do not have a formal online presence. This is quite similar to traditional offline archives, for instance manuscript collections. For such collections, CMOS suggests:\n\nKallen, Horace. Papers. YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York.\n\n\nMerriam, Charles E. Papers. Special Collections Research Center, box 26, folder 17. University of Chicago Library.\n\nand usage in the text as\n\nAlvin Johnson, in a memorandum prepared sometime in 1937 (Kallen Papers, file 36), observed that …\n\nSimilar citations can be constructed for offline databases:\n\nBloom, Nick. 2019. Confidential survey data on Cameroon business processes. Stanford Secure Access Center (file “cameroon-bloom.zip”). Stanford University.\n\n\n\nConfidential databases\nSimilar forms may be used for confidential databases when no DOI exists:\n\nInternal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Department of Treasury, Washington DC, accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nwhere the data, in this case, were accessed via the “Department of Treasury,” acting as a secure distributor (of access, not downloads). If the same data had been accessed via a secure research data center, the reference should have instead noted that access mechanism:\n\nInternal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Federal Research Data Centers distributor, last accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n\nNational Tax Administration. 2015. “Társasági Adóalanyok Mérleg - és Eredménykimutatásai [Dataset].” Magyar Nemzeti Bank distributor. Last accessed at YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nIf multiple databases within the same secure confines are used and combined, they should be cited (within reason) separately. Guidance here may be: Can and do researchers combine various extracts in different ways? For instance, do some combine the IRS 1040 database with death records, and others merge elements from the IRS 1040 database with information returns? Then the information returns, and the 1040 file should be cited separately.\n\nGovernment registers\nIn some cases, governments have list of their (named) registers. For instance, Statistics Denmark provides the full list of registers at https://www.dst.dk/extranet/forskningvariabellister/Oversigt%20over%20registre.html. These can be used to craft data citations, for instance\n\nStatistics Denmark. 2020. “Døde i Danmark (DOD, Deaths in Denmark), 1970-2019 [database]”, Danmarks Statistiks Forskningsservice, accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nwhere the “author” is Statistics Denmark, but the “[publisher]” is the research service of Statistics Denmark. You should note the version (for instance, the current register goes through 2019, but you may have had access to an earlier version, so you should adjust accordingly). In the manuscript, you would then cite “Statistics Denmark (2020)”. If available, the README can point to the codebook for each register, e.g., https://www.dst.dk/extranet/ForskningVariabellister/DOD%20-%20D%C3%B8de%20i%20Danmark.html for the aforementioned “DOD” register. An example can be found in Fadlon and Nielsen (2021).\n\n\nConfidential data with DOI\nIf a DOI exists, the formal citation generated from that DOI should be used:\n\nForschungsdatenzentrum der Bundesagentur für Arbeit. 2020. “Betriebs-Historik-Panel (BHP) – Version 7518 v1.” Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB). https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.BHP7518.DE.EN.V1.\n\n\n\n\nNo formal access mechanism\nIn some cases (not infrequently), access to data is through informal means. The CMOS allows for citation of such information, without inclusion in the references.\n\n(A. P. Møller, unpublished data; C. R. Brown and M. B. Brown, unpublished data)\n\nWe would deviate from that suggestion, ask for inclusion in the reference list, and simply suggest using unpublished data as the locator, similar to a URN, in the reference list:\n\nMøller, A. P. n.d. “Data on Crocodile Sightings in Manhattan.” Unpublished data. Accessed February 29, 2019.\n\n\n\nData provider cannot be named\nIn some cases, the data provider (often a firm) must remain anonymous. This does not prevent citation, and the provider should be mentioned in much the same way as when there is no formal access mechanism:\n\nAnonymous Firm. 1999. “Personnel records of windowshield installers.” Unpublished data. Accessed February 29, 2000.\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors or Producer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of publication:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistent identifier or URL:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of access:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessed or downloaded?\n\n\n Accessed  Downloaded",

The README should provide a sufficient description to understand the structure of the replication archive (directory structure, what is acquired from third parties, what is generated by scripts, how much output to expect). It should document each file or class of files that are included.\nWe strongly encourage the provision of a master script. The master script should run all programs necessary to provide the outputs, in the right sequence, robustly.\nIn some cases, the master script might also serve as a README (for instance, “README.bash”, “README.py”, “README.Rmd”), as long as it satisfies all conditions of the README as well (i.e., ample comments).\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nWe strongly encourage the use of a single configuration file, containing all path names.\nWe strongly encourage the use of relative paths for including programs, data, and outputs in the main program\nWe strongly encourage listing ALL dependencies and packages needed to run.\n\nincluding them in the project\nor listing them out in a “setup” program\n\nWe strongly encourage setting any seeds for random number generators\nSample configuration for Stata\nSample configuration for R\nPython way\n\n\n\nThings not to do\n\nWe strongly discourage writing comments like\n\nRun this a first time, generating column 1 of Table 3.\nThen comment out line 55, then run a second time, which should\ngive you column 3 of Table 3.\nThen uncomment line 55, change the parameter in line 67 to \"5\",\nand run again to get column 2 of Table 3.\n(this is only slightly paraphrased from an actual example). - Avoid ambiguous or imprecise instructions like\nHave superDynare available\nor\nUse the outreg55 package\n(no URL or installation command provided)\n\n\n\nxkcd-data-pipeline\n\n\n\n\nThings to do\n\nExplain briefly how to RUN your code - do not assume that everybody now or in the future knows how to run make, Matlab+Dynare, or even Stata.\nWrite code that can be run without human intervention, ideally without using a graphical interface.\nUse functions/programs/loops/etc. to iterate through variations of an otherwise identical procedure (but ensure that the purpose of the loop is well described)\nIdentify all requirements to allow somebody to successfully run the code who has NOT been experimenting with the software and code for the past 5 years on the same laptop.

Authors should consult with a qualified party, such as a university counsel or a lawyer, as appropriate.\n\n\nDefault\nWhen depositing in a Code and Data Repository, a license needs to be chosen. If not chosen through the menu, a license file (typically named LICENSE.txt or LICENSE.md) needs to be provided.\n\n\nSome guidance on licensing of databases and software:\n\nCornell’s Research Data Management Service Group\nStodden, Victoria. “Enabling Reproducible Research: Open Licensing For Scientific Innovation”, International Journal of Communications Law and Policy, Issue 13, 2009.\nBitlaw.com, “Database Legal Protection, accessed at https://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/database.html#compilations on Sept 12, 2019.\n\nFor the purpose of replicability, journals will usually insist on an open license that allows for replication by researchers unconnected to the original parties, to the extent allowed by other agreements and the law. - For data-only repositories, possible licenses include the  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License or the more liberal  [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication] - For code-only repositories, possible licenses include  3-Clause (Modified) BSD Clause, though other open-source licenses are equally acceptable (see https://opensource.org/licenses). “Code” or “Software” is any statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result, and may include interpretive, object or source code. The CC-BY license is not recommended for software.\n\n\nDual-License Setup\nMany repositories contain both code and databases. In that case, the repository might contain files under different licenses. For instance, some components may come with more restrictive licenses (MIT License for software from third parties) or more lenient licenses (CC0 license for own code), with a third license for databases.\n\nDual-license Example\nThe AEA provides an example of a dual-license setup, suitable for use by depositors to various journals’ data and code repositories (see the LICENSE-template). It combines\n\n Modified BSD License, applies to all code, scripts, programs, and SOFTWARE\n Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License, applies to databases, images, tables, text, and any other objects\n\n\n\nMulti-license Example\nIn the example below, drawn from Greenelab, the specific types of files are identified by “glob patterns” or regular expressions, but explicit naming of files or directories could also be applied.\n \n\nExcept when noted otherwise, the entirety of this repository is licensed under a CC BY 4.0 License (LICENSE.md), which allows reuse with attribution.\n\n\nSince CC BY is not ideal for code and data, certain repository components are also released under the CC0 1.0 public domain dedication (LICENSE-CC0.md).

To suggest an addition, please issue a pull request, or email one of the editors.\n\n\nPermanent Identifiers: Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) et al\nA sufficient, but not necessary criterion for a “trusted repository” is the assignment of permanent identifiers, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOI).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR30261.v6\n\nSome repositories (often university-based) ones will also assign handles:\n\nhttps://hdl.handle.net/1813/45789\n\nOthers assign DOI upon demand. We generally suggest requesting a DOI if possible. Examples:\n\nOn OSF, users can request DOIs for projects\nOn university repositories, request procedures may look like this page at Cornell University\n\nHowever, care must be taken when using permanent identifiers: the URL in the address bar is (almost) never the same as the DOI or handle. All permanent identifiers are redirects: they constitute a permanent entry that points to wherever the most recent version of the object can be found:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR30261.v6 is a DOI that redirects to https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/30261 (as of June 2020).\nhttps://hdl.handle.net/1813/45789 is a handle that redirects to https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/45789\n\nOnly the first entry in each of the examples above should be used for citing, not the second.\n\n\nNOT ACCEPTABLE\nA variety of (unfortunately) commonly used web-accessible locations are not acceptable as data repositories for the purpose of an article’s supplementary materials:\n\nGithub, Gitlab, etc. because a project’s owner can delete a git repository at any time (but see this page on how to leverage Zenodo to enable proper archiving of code and software) (see also questions in the FAQ);\nGoogle pages, university and personal faculty web pages - they can all be deleted by the owner or by the employer (the university) without regards to archival characteristics of its contents (but talk to your university library - they may have a way to facilitate archiving of web pages - and investigate the Wayback Machine for a similar purpose);\nDropbox, Box.com, and similar cloud-based data and file sharing services - again, they can all be deleted at short notice, or when payment stops\n\n\n\n\nSome good examples\n\n“Immigration Restrictions as Active Labor Market Policy: Evidence from the Mexican Bracero Exclusion, Replication files and raw data” (Michael Clemens) - Hosted on Harvard Dataverse at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/bracero - Contains two datasets: - Clemens, Michael, 2017, “Raw scanned PDFs of primary sources for workers, wages, and crops”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DJHVHB, Harvard Dataverse, V1 - Clemens, Michael, 2018, “Replication Data for: Immigration Restrictions as Active Labor Market Policy: Evidence from the Mexican Bracero Exclusion”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/17M4ZP, Harvard Dataverse, V1\n\n\n“United States Newspaper Panel, 1869-2004” (Gentzkow, Shapiro, Sinkinson) - Hosted on ICPSR at https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/30261 - Contains - Gentzkow, Matthew, Shapiro, Jesse M., and Sinkinson, Michael. United States Newspaper Panel, 1869-2004. Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor], 2014-12-10. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR30261.v6\n\n\n“Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Dataset for India (SHRUG)” (Asher and Novosad) - Hosted on Harvard Dataverse at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DPESAK - Contains: - Asher, Sam; Novosad, Paul, 2019, “Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Dataset for India (SHRUG)”, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DPESAK, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:Upe25NYAZwR+6VsDt5X2lQ==\n\n\n\nChallenges in Hosting of Data and Code at Restricted-Access Data Centers\nUsers of restricted-access data centers (RADC, such as FSRDCs, CASD, etc.) face certain challenges in the handling of data and code as described in this document:\n\nresearchers (end-users) may not be able to provide DOI or similar persistent identifiers for some data\nresearchers may not be able to discern the presrvation policy for certain data sets\nresearchers may not be able to remove all code from the center, or such removal is subject to restrictions\ndata citation guidance may be lacking, or may not be obvious (see Data Citation Guidance for general guidance)\n\n\nA few guidelines\n\nRequest as much code as the RADC will allow the researcher to remove. Subsequently handle it equivalently to the general code guidance, but make special note (placeholders, explanatory text) of any redacted information.\nIn addition, some RADC may provide the ability to deposit code internally and confidentially. Use such interal repositories, and make a note of their location in the publicly deposited code or in supplementary documents.\n\n\n\nSelf-generated repositories (second best)\nIf a RADC has at least an archival or backup policy of sufficient length (e.g., 10 or more years), but does not offer a formal repository, then the following procedure allows users to find and request code and data - As before, request as much code as is feasible, and deposit it in a public repository (e.g., openICPSR, Dataverse, Zenodo). Don’t publish it yet. - If possible at such repositories, pre-register a DOI - At Zenodo: click the appropriation request button, and a DOI will be assigned, e.g., 10.5281/zenodo.NNNNN. - At openICPSR: projects are called openicpsr-NNNNN. The DOI is derived from the project number as 10.3886/ENNNNNV1. - If you already have a DOI assigned to your manuscript or (published) paper, you can alternatively use that (see 10.1093/restud/rdw057 for an excellent example). - In the RADC, create a two-level directory with the name of the DOI. - Move both data (following guidelines outlined here) and all code (not just the confidential part) to subdirectories. The resulting directory structure will look something like this:\n/some/path/project/10.5281/zenodo.NNNNN/:\n      data/original/rawdata.dta\n      data/derived/analysis.dta\n      programs/01_cleaning.do\n      programs/02_analysis.do\n\nConfirm with the RADC’s administrative staff how long project files are kept as archives or in backup (often 5-10 years)\nAdd a statement to the public README.md (and to article materials). See Sample RADC Statement 1 and Sample RADC Statement 2.\n\n\n\nSome examples\n\nFort (2016) 10.1093/restud/rdw057, in the supplementary materials (local copy)\nGroen, Kutzbach, and Polivka (2019, forthcoming) (link to be supplied upon publication)\nSee also section on Data and Code Availability Statements.",
